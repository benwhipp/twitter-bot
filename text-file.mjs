Both films are, at least by some definitions, documentaries that are comprised of interviews and true events, but as we shall see neither approach these in a conventional sense. I will attempt to demonstrate how, by looking at their novel approaches to their subject matter, we can consider them to be conducting work that makes them worthy of genuine philosophical consideration, as well how they highlight and ask complex ethical questions. I will show how this is reflected within both the form and the content of the films, and how it is through the interaction of these elements that they perform work that cannot be replicated completely in a linguistic medium outside of their status as films. In this sense, I hope to make the case that they fulfil the criteria set by the essays I examine below, and show how this is a constitutive force behind their aesthetic strength. \ In his essay on cinema as philosophy, Paisley Livingston attempts to take to task that which he calls a flawed ‘bold thesis’ (2006, p. 11) made by some regarding what we might consider the philosophical competence of film as a medium. He identifies the two key elements of this thesis as being ‘a conception of which sorts of exclusive capacities of the cinematic medium (or art form) are said to make a special contribution to philosophy’, and strong ‘claims about the significance and independence of the latter contribution’. This is realised as he sees it via an argument which, at its strongest, attempts to make the claim that ‘a film can provide a historically innovative contribution to knowledge regarding some philosophical topic, doing so in a significantly independent or autonomous manner’ that is not ‘dependent on a subsequent paraphrase’. Thus, he takes issue with the idea that a film can, as an artwork, make a significant philosophical contribution to the wider dialectic in such a way that is inseparable from its expression in a filmic manner—one that cannot be fully articulated or ‘paraphrased’ in writing elsewhere. This issue of paraphrase forms the crux of Livingston’s criticism as he argues that, if a work cannot be subsequently paraphrased and examined linguistically, ‘reasonable doubt arises with regard to its very existence’ (p. 12). \ As he explores this problem with more detail, further issues arise for Livingston regarding the constraints that the thesis places upon philosophical thought, and the capacity for film to express it, in its attempts to separate film from other art forms. He argues that, even if we are to consider uniquely filmic devices, such as montage, camera-work, the relationship of sound and image etc., the film as a work still heavily relies upon ‘linguistically articulated background thoughts that are mobilized in both the creation and interpretation of the film’s philosophical significance’ (p. 13). He sees anyone making the types of claims that characterise the bold thesis as actively downplaying these linguistic elements and unduly favouring a film’s form over its content, at the expense of the work of art as a whole. He even goes as far as to make a Hegelian criticism of this manner of artistic interpretation, seeing it as a heavy-handed attempt to look to an artwork for ‘instruction’ (p. 17), instead of appreciating it for ‘its own intrinsic value’. While this final element goes beyond the scope of my essay, it is I think an important point to bear in mind, particularly regarding films that overtly deal with questions of ethics and of which it is all too easy to approach as a series of fables. It is however not core to Livingston’s argument as I see it; instead I wish to explore the problem of paraphrase and how it bears upon the two films I am considering. \ At their core, both films pose the questions of how we are to approach, acknowledge, record, and importantly stage the testimony of those placed in intolerably traumatic situations. The primary element they share is that both films attempt to do this by transforming, or elevating, the testimony of those they engage with to the level of art, although it should be said both do so with the greatest of care, attention, and sympathy. To the filmmakers’ credits, both Barnard and Herzog succeed in creating works that are thoroughly moving and humanistic in their outlook, and demonstrate a clear concern with maintaining the articulative powers of the interviewees rather than considering their experiences secondary to the filmmaker’s vision. However, they both approach the question of how best to represent this testimony in very different ways, and it is these differences that I wish to briefly outline. \ In The Arbor, Barnard has recorded a number of audio interviews with friends, family members, and other people associated with the playwright Andrea Dunbar, and has filmed actors lip-syncing these testimonies whilst acting through various dramatic scenes. Often these simply take the form of what would be considered a fairly conventional interview setup, with the actors talking to the camera in a plausibly domestic or every-day setting, such as their home or place of work. Barnard uses this to great effect with the character of Lorraine, foreshadowing the events of the film’s second half by placing her largely within a prison cell, but only making it absolutely clear what this location is during when it becomes relevant to the narrative. \ There are also sequences which clearly border on the fantastic, and play with the line between fact and fiction, such as the film’s poignant opening scene in which Lorraine and Dunbar’s other daughter, Lisa, begin their testimony in what appears to be their childhood house. As they speak, they explore the rooms of the house as if conducting an excavation of their memories, with the elements they speak about manifesting around them as they talk. We see an actor playing Dunbar herself, ‘comatose’ on her bed, as well as flash-backs of her closing a bedroom door and removing the handle, performing the action as it is narrated by her daughters. Lorraine speaks of how as a child she set fire to the room in order to keep her brother and sister warm, and the actor performs this action in the present day. As the bed of their bedroom is set ablaze she and her sister stand before it, apparently unaware, or uncaring, and tell their stories. It is also apparent that neither of the sisters are aware of the other’s presence within the space, or else they make no acknowledgement of each other, despite the fact that they stand side-by-side and speak in turn. Barnard here brings the two testimonies that have presumably been recorded separately into the same space on-screen, and uses this sequence to begin to show how the offset narratives do not agree with each other throughout her film. The gesture simultaneously brings them together and highlights the distance between them. \ This gesture is reflected elsewhere within the film. At various points, we see what appears to be a number of actors performing scenes from Dunbar’s titular 1980 play, The Arbor, in the present-day common central to the actual Brafferton Arbor street in which Dunbar grew up, whilst a crowd of (we presume) current residents watch. We the audience are provided with no real context in these scenes, besides their introduction by the actor playing Andrea Dunbar who says which act and scene they are taken from. Barnard’s blurring of fact and fiction here maintains a tension in which we cannot say for certain whether the footage here of those we take to be the residents is in any way staged, or if so to what degree. Indeed she has the actors at various points freely mingle with this crowd, participating as both performers and witnesses to each other. Even her more traditional documentary-style establishing shots of the street, such as an early scene in which we see children playing, has them looking at the camera and audibly calling on one boy to backflip from a street sign as a performance for it. Barnard maintains the sense that the camera is intruding upon and affecting those it records in such a manner that refuses our attempts to fully suspend our disbelief or critical faculties. In this way the act of observation becomes proactive and engaged. She embarks on an effort to keep the testimony alive and dynamic, even as she demonstrates its fractured nature and lack of definitive, singular coherence. \ In his film Herzog takes a rather different approach. Into the Abyss is in many ways a far more conventional documentary, comprised of direct video recordings of its interviewees and Herzog’s typical voiceover narration of events as they are depicted. However, it is filled with subtle implicit elements and devices that, like The Arbor, highlight particular aspects of its narratives and resists an easy and straightforward interpretation. In the opening sequence, we have, like The Arbor, the slow visual exploration of an important space to the film’s narrative: a ‘Death House’ holding cell and execution chamber. However, in this instance, we the audience do not see characters going through this space; instead it is the camera that slowly drifts through it, and we ourselves are the explorers carefully examining the details before us. The hand-held camera walks slowly from one end to another, stopping to note a table that stands before the holding cell, and upon which are flowers, tissues, and bibles in different languages. It turns as it passes the cell itself, and we see a sparse, entirely functional space only as long and wide as the single bed it contains, with room next to it for a toilet, and a small metal table protruding from the cell’s bars. The camera slowly moves forward and stops before an open door, peering inside to see the gurney, covered in straps, upon which the condemned will be executed via lethal injection. The film cuts here to a slow pan inside that space, beginning on the clock that overlooks the gurney, before slowly turning to come face to face with the object itself. The scene ends with a final series of shots, including a pair of switches labelled ‘ON OFF WITNESS’, the spot light that faces the condemned, and the microphone that hangs above them. This final image also contains in the background the viewing window through which the witnesses watch the execution, and indeed this series seems to heavily emphasise the theatrical element of the proceedings, something that is touched upon at numerous times throughout the film. Like The Arbor, the notion of performance is made key to the narrative. The final pan moves the camera from the microphone down to the empty pillow upon which the condemned’s head lies, and the absence of any person lying there only makes stronger the sense in which the presences of those that have been here, and will be here in the future, are felt within this scene. \ We can see here illustrated what Barnaby Norman talks about when he says that the film is ‘structured around a ‘scene’ which, while absent from the film itself, nevertheless organises every element of the narrative’ (2013, p. 205). This scene is that of Michael Perry’s actual execution, and Norman is correct when he notes that the effect this absence has is not mere omission, but instead evokes Roland Barthes’ stadium/punctum distinction in his book Camera Lucida: ‘even before it has done its work, […] death is at work in the photographic image, and this immanence of death (its indwelling) makes of time itself the new punctum’ (2013, p. 207). Herzog’s film is marked in this way by a disrupted temporality: the fact that we cannot say for certain in many interviews whether it has occurred before, or after, Perry’s execution leaves us in a strangely charged space. It is an event that is both simultaneously going to occur, and has already occurred. If we reconsider the execution chamber exploration in light of this, we can perhaps account more fully for the strange weight that the scene holds. We cannot say viewing it whether the execution has occurred at the time of filming; we do not know if this is the place in which Perry has died, or where he is in fact going to die; we do not even know if this is in fact his execution chamber. Whilst it seems on the surface that Herzog takes pains to always contextualise his audience in events, unlike Barnard, this is actually not the case. He still finds space to denaturalise the filming process and cause the audience to reflect carefully upon the images they see. \ The spectral, almost dream-like quality of the opening sequence draws upon the imaginations of its audience to fill in and occupy the spaces it depicts. Herzog here very clearly wants his audience not merely to see the execution space, but to inhabit it and personify those who we know will pass through it. He continues this with the following scene in which we encounter Perry for the first time. As Herzog speaks he makes it very clear to both him and to the audience his own stance on events, and his unapologetic personal views: ‘I have the feeling that destiny, in a way, has dealt you a very bad deck of cards. It does not exonerate you, and when I talk to you it does not necessarily mean that I have to like you. But I respect you, and you are a human being and I think that human beings should not be executed.’ Thus, in a couple sentences, Herzog clearly outlines his methodology: he does not agree with capital punishment, or think that it is just, but at the same time he has no desire to reduce or mitigate the consequences that the actions of the two murderers caused. It is via this explicit subjectivity, like Barnard, that Herzog feels it best to ensure his interviewees’ voices will remain articulate within his film. \ This focus, as outlined here by Herzog, appears to centre upon the ethical responsibility of a film, and by extension the film-maker, to adequately do justice to those whose story they purport to tell. This opens up the entire process that both he and Barnard have undertaken however to potential criticisms. One could quite fairly make the argument that, whatever artistic merit the final work may hold, a filmmaker simply has no ethical justification for taking a narrative of real, traumatic events, in which they had no part, and inserting themselves overtly in such a manner that takes advantage of the canonising authority of a feature film. Whether this insertion is via a device as clear as appearing on screen and in the film’s voice-over narration, or by distorting the recorded witness’ testimonies via the use of lip-syncing actors and fictive elements in scenes, the argument that neither filmmaker has any right to do what they have done remains a potent one. To take this argument to its extreme, one could even make the case that they are actively harming those they purport to depict: by framing their narratives within the various filmic devices that the filmmakers have chosen as opposed to representing their testimony in a full, unedited, and otherwise generally ‘non-artistic’ form, they are only able to reach an audience via the lens of the filmmaker’s vision. \ There are further observations that can be made when following this line of criticism. One could go on to object that neither film partakes in a great enough condemnation of the crimes that form its core narrative. To take Into the Abyss: whilst it does not go in any way towards endorsing Michael Perry or Jason Burkett’s actions, or attempt to excuse them via recourse to the boys’ troubled upbringing, still it remains that the documentary takes great care in humanising them above and beyond that we might expect for those who have caused such extreme pain and suffering. We see this in Herzog’s choice of interviewees: the extended sequences of Burkett’s father for example, in which he speaks of how he feels ‘a total failure as a father’, and the memorable image he describes of him sat handcuffed to his son in the back of a prison bus, the two of them both serving life sentences. Herzog’s editing choices also: near the end of chapter four, Herzog intercuts footage of Lisa Stotler-Balloun, the daughter and sister of the victims, talking about her catharsis at witnessing Perry’s execution and her shock at his youthful appearance with footage he recorded prior to the execution showing Perry smiling and joking with the prison officers in the visiting booth. The precise line she says as this happens is ‘I remember walking in and thinking ‘this looks like a boy’: I had built this huge monster, evil, you know, murdering monster in my head and he was just a boy’. We as the audience are clearly supposed to echo this sentiment, and in this way feel sympathy for this person whose crimes are clearly abhorrent. The argument can be made that this constitutes an ethical flaw in the film, and thus also an aesthetic one if were to take a moralist stance on it and leave the analysis here. \ We might go so far as to identify this negatively as a ‘merited response’ outlined by Berys Gaut (2002, p. 351) in his essay on art and aesthetics. Simply put, Gaut argues that, from a moralist point of view, ‘when works manifest attitudes, they do so by prescribing or inviting their audiences to have certain responses’, and that ‘a work is intrinsically ethically flawed just in case it manifests ethically reprehensive attitudes’. A response to a work is ‘merited’ for Gaut, if this corresponds reasonably to what the work appears to be trying to achieve—fear and revulsion in horror films for example, or amusement in comedies. From a moralist perspective, a work is not only morally flawed, but also aesthetically so, if the response it attempts to illicit from its audience is ethically wrong—taking pleasure in the torture of others, for example. In this way, Gaut says we can identify a work’s prescribed response as unmerited, as it contradicts what we would consider to be our ingrained ethical code. This opens a series of interesting avenues regarding the assumptions one has to make about any shared set of ethical values, but for the purposes of this essay I will simply assume that, at least in a general sense, most people will agree that murder is wrong, particularly if it’s committed in the course of further crimes. Taking this assumption to be true, we can then argue that Herzog’s film, whatever other merits it may hold, attempts to prescribe a sympathetic outlook in its audience towards the two boys who committed the murders, and thus is ethically and aesthetically flawed for attempting to generate this unmerited response. This would be further supported by noting that this prescription also appears to be one of the central aims of the film, which fulfils another of Gaut’s criteria to a moralist criticism that the work of art ‘is always aesthetically flawed only insofar as it possesses an ethical flaw which is aesthetically relevant’ (p. 349) to the work as a whole. \ Now, this line of criticism could well apply to The Arbor as much as Into the Abyss, given the central role it grants to Lorraine despite her crimes. Both filmmakers seem to place at the heart of their projects an attempt to provoke a deep sympathy in the audience for characters who have carried out terrible actions. However, I wish to argue that, contrary to the conclusion that this fact ethically and aesthetically compromises the films, it is precisely because of this that both films maintain their ethical integrity and in doing so make valuable contributions to the field of ethics in ways that utilise their uniquely filmic devices and that fulfil Livingston’s sceptical demands of the ‘bold thesis’. \  If we consider Barnard’s own comments on her film, we can see that she that she considers that her film is ‘about responsibility; the responsibility of the filmmaker, individual, and collective responsibility’ (2010b, p. 5). She sets her approach apart from those typically employed in depicting housing estates and other scenes of poverty in a socially realist manner, instead aiming to ‘draw attention to the fact that documentary narratives are as constructed as fictional ones’ (p. 4), in an attempt to make the audience ‘think about the fact that the film has been shaped and edited by the filmmakers’. The aspects of her film that I have described above conform to this vision, and it is here that I argue we find the core ‘message’ of the work, if we were to attempt to (somewhat reductively) boil it down to a single defining idea. Gaut is right in this instance when he says that ‘our aesthetic practices are laden with ethical evaluations’ (2002, p. 345): in considering our responses to the film on an aesthetic level, it makes no sense whatsoever to approach those elements that cause The Arbor to stir such an effective emotive reaction to the lives of its characters without also weighing upon the complex ethical problems that their stories partake in. One can hardly account for the terrible impact, for example, of Harris’ death, without also taking into account the stories of abuse, imprisonment, and addiction that Lorraine has told leading to this point. Rather than excuse her actions, or ‘explain’ the death in a way that lessens its impact, these framing narratives serve to increase its impact dramatically, as the audience is far more invested within the story than they would have otherwise been. \ This is never made clearer than in the scene near the end of the film, in which the actors playing Lorraine’s’ foster parents, Ann and Steve, are watching the real BBC news report that was broadcast describing her trial and subsequent conviction. The report feigns the cool, objective perspective of a purely factual account, and yet is riddled with elements that cynically and starkly contradict this when placed within the context of the overtly staged film scene. It contains the tabloid style ‘revelation’ that Harris had himself developed a craving for Methadone, and would hold out his arms screaming for it when Lorraine took it herself, as well as extensive reference to Andrea’s death as an easy way to ‘explain’ Lorraine’s own difficult life and drug abuse. It is also replete with shots of run down, empty Bradford housing estates as a means of illustrating its content in a way that seems exceptionally heartless, as if the tragic circumstances can be summed up by recourse to a stereotyped signifier. Steve’s response that they ‘embroidered it a little bit didn’t they’ understates the fact that this seemingly objective report hangs on a false and lazy melodrama that fails in any way to actually understand the events it relays. \ Of course, it is hardly fair to compare the level of emotive and cognitive depth possible within a two minute broadcast to that of a feature film, but its inclusion I feel draws attention once more to the mechanics of Barnard’s filmmaking and denaturalises the images and sounds onscreen. It illustrates the disjunction between an official, ‘newsworthy’ narrative and those of the actual participants of the story. Rather than simply resulting in another narrative among narratives, the effect is to highlight the fragility of speech and the lack of a final, definitive story that will, in some sense, cleanly ‘wrap up’ events and provide a level of objective distancing. Ben Walters calls this effect a ‘speech impediment’:  \ There’s trauma but no catharsis. In The Arbor’s echo chamber of disembodied voices, eerily suspended somewhere between documentary and drama, the misfit between speaker and performer never stops reminding us of an alienation—a miscasting at the level of social identity itself—that [unlike the in film The King’s Speech] no doctor-teacher can remedy. \ 								(2011, p. 7) \ In this sense, we can consider the films in one light as cases in a soft ‘cognitivist’ (Gaut 2002, p. 349) argument for moralism. Whilst they never go as far as to explicitly attempt to teach their audiences how to consider the moral questions they raise, both films demonstrate the extreme complexity that lies at what apparently appears to be straightforward stories, and thus causes them to engage serious consideration of their own opinions and values in light of what occurs onscreen.  \ This is however, only one small part of the philosophical achievement these films reach. As I have discussed above, both also partake in complex exercises in the performative nature of testimony its multifaceted nature. Whilst I have attempted as best I can to paraphrase, for example, the various devices Barnard employs throughout her film for the purposes of linguistic interpretation, I think it is fair to say that the effect of actually sitting down and viewing the film itself far outstrips anything I can reasonably capture of it in this essay. This is to the film’s credit: it would be irresponsible, given the subject matter and the moral weight of protecting the interviewees’ testimony, to present a final work that does not reflect the unique and important nature of their stories. In this way, the film’s form echoes its content. \ Thus, when we consider whether we can say that it truly contributes to philosophical thought on ethics in a meaningful sense, I think Paisley Livingston’s assertion that film is best used ‘as an illustration’ (2006, p. 16) of broader ideas, aimed at ‘the stimulation of students’ imaginative engagement with philosophical issues’ falls short. Far from relying upon paraphrase to ‘provide an interpretive statement or thinking through of [their] meanings’ (p. 13), the films utterly reject this kind of reductionism as a fundamental part of the work they conduct and incorporate this evasion into the aims they set out to achieve. They remain, in the final instance, without unity or closure, and this fact is, I think, one of the key contributions they make to the field. \ In this essay, I have shown how, via a variety of means, both films attempt to create in their audience a sense of critical distance that allows them space for complex philosophical consideration. I have argued that due to the troubling moral problems that occur within the films, both filmmakers have fully realised their own ethical obligations to both their subjects and their audiences, and have responded accordingly by producing artworks that maintain robust sets of principles and beliefs. Through the use of subjective storytelling and other means, both films fulfil Paisley Livingston’s ‘bold thesis’ with regards to film’s philosophical competence as a medium, and do so in such a way that cannot be fully articulated in a purely linguistic medium. In this way, I have shown that they make ‘historically innovative philosophical contributions’ (Livingston 2006, p. 11) entirely because they are able, as films, to perform the thoughts that they embody in a way echoed through their form and content. It is finally this performativity that marks their unique contributions as films opposed to other media, and it is here that we might find some satisfactory counter to Livingston’s assertions. \ In What Sense Are Photography and Cinema ‘Transparent’ Media? \ In this essay I will be examining the question of how photography and cinema are ‘transparent’ media by analysing a number of claims made by Roger Scruton in his essay ‘Photography and Representation’ (1981), and exploring the concept of ‘transparency’ as a response to these. I will begin with Scruton’s assumptions regarding the necessary conditions for art to be ‘representative’ in his schema, before turning to an analysis of Kendall Walton’s conception of photographic ‘transparency’ as exemplified in Jonathan Friday (1996) and Dominic Lopes (2003), and follow this with my own analysis of Scruton’s claims in light of this and concluding that photography and film are in fact capable of representative aesthetics. \ For Scruton, photography, and by extension, film, lacks the capacity for artistic representation because of its perceived directly causal relationship with the objects it depicts in a mechanical sense. In order for representation to occur, Scruton requires that an artwork stand in an ‘intentional relation’ (1981, p. 578) to its subject, one in which there is some clear mediation between artist and audience. This is what allows, for him, the idea of thought processes to enter into an artistic work; he argues for example that it is for this reason we ‘cannot rest satisfied with nature but must have works of art as the objects of aesthetic judgement’ (p. 593), that the natural world cannot carry thought whereas man-made art can. Lopes summarises Scruton’s arguments regarding this lack of representative capability as ‘an equivalence thesis’ (2003, p. 434), which states that any aesthetic interest we take in a photograph is in fact interest only in the object it depicts, and that in this way the two things are equivalent. Lopes splits this further into what he calls the ‘object argument’ (p. 435) and the ‘style argument’ (p. 436), and it is to the former that I wish to divert my attention. \ The ‘object argument’ is that in which Scruton says that ‘photographs may serve as conduits for aesthetic interest, but they cannot be objects of aesthetic interest in their own right, as long as they are seen as photographs’ (2003, p. 435). The photograph stands as merely a way of transporting the viewer to a potential point that they could, in theory, stand from and view the object as the camera viewed it (in the case of distorted photographs, the argument remains that there had to have been a scene prior to the distortion, whose existence can be at least hypothetically reconstructed from the photograph and a viewer able to see it). This would be equivalent in Scruton’s thought to ‘mark[ing] out a certain spot from which a particular view of a street may be obtained’ (1981, p. 596), and placing a frame there. There must have been a real scene that directly caused the photographic image, and thus, in the object argument, when we view a photograph with aesthetic interest, all we are really doing is viewing this scene with aesthetic interest as if we were standing before it physically and viewing it through a frame. \ This reductionism is obviously problematic, for Scruton seems in his essay to go beyond the simple argument of artistic representation and instead begins a rather less rigorous series of criticisms based on what can only be described as personal taste. He makes claims for example that camera-work, far from heightening cinematic art and opening possibilities for, as he terms it, ‘dramatic representation’, instead serves only to ‘create irrelevancies and at the same time persuade us to ignore them’ (p. 599), something he comments as being ‘crude in comparison with the simpler devices of the [theatrical] stage’. He continues along this train of thought by arguing that, as film images contain many elements that remain beyond a director’s control, they are unable to effectively carry clear singular thoughts that may be considered the film’s primary ‘message’, despite also saying that films are too ‘concrete’ in their depictions and leave ‘nothing to the imagination’ (p. 601) of audiences. It seems clear to me that Scruton’s misgivings regarding photography and film go beyond a simple philosophical dispute, however, it is through the notion of them as transparent media that I argue we may most effectively counter these opinions and account for the clear artistic value of both. \ There are those who disagree with the prevailing notion articulated thus far that the causal relationship between photography and its object is so straightforward. Jonathan Friday notes a distinction between a ‘direct realist or a representationalist’ (1996, p. 35) causal theory that problematizes the strict translation of an object on to the photographic medium. Whilst Scruton’s position is that of the direct realist, a representationalist would argue that all images one sees are necessarily mediated via the brain and that therefore there is no direct causal link between an object and its depiction in a photograph, as it must be further incorporated into my head as a ‘mental picture’ (p. 36) if I am to comprehend it. Whilst Friday doubts the plausibility of this line of reasoning, he poses for us the possibility that Scruton’s assumptions are not strictly given within the debate. This leads to a notion of photographic transparency that differs from Scruton’s equivalence theory in a subtle respect. In this sense, Walton’s notion of ‘seeing-through’ means that ‘when we look at a photograph we quite literally see the object it depicts’ (p. 30), as photographs are transparent. Whilst this re-establishes the importance of the photographic frame in the process, Friday largely maintains Scruton’s assertions that photography cannot be a source of aesthetic representation, despite his noting that ‘representation is not the only, or even the most important, source of aesthetic value’ (1996, p. 41). It is to Dominic Lopes I wish to turn in order to synthesise these two views, and to argue that in fact transparency does imply that photography and film carry representative capacities.  \ For Lopes, Scruton’s equivalence thesis rests on a faulty assumption due to his misunderstanding of the causal relationship of a photograph to its object. Rather than equating aesthetic interest in a photograph with that of its object as if it were there, Lopes notes that all that is necessarily implied by this relationship is that ‘the interest one may properly take in seeing a photograph as a photograph is necessarily identical to the interest one may properly take in seeing the photographed object through the photograph’ (2003, p. 441). To return to Scruton’s analogy about placing a frame within a street: if one were to look through the frame, whilst it remains true that we continue to literally see the street, it is also simultaneously true that we are doing so through the frame, and that this remains a constitutive element to the experience. However, this metaphor is a flawed means of understanding photography, as photographs do not depict reality in this way, but instead allow us to freeze particular moments in time, bridge spatial and temporal gaps, disturb objects as we record them, and carry out other operations that are unique to the medium (pp. 443-4). Thus, photography allows us to examine reality in a light not normally accessible in our day-to-day existence, and it is from this basis that Lopes argues ‘a photographic aesthetics grounded in transparency is viable’ (p. 442). \ Via this understanding, it becomes clear that film as a medium is in fact rich with opportunity for aesthetic representation. To take the instance of John Smith’s film The Girl Chewing Gum (1976), if we approach the film as an exercise in filmic transparency that overlays multiple artistic elements we are able to see how there are at least three scenes or objects being simultaneously depicted within the film. The first is that of the recorded street scene, sans any audio commentary, that we literally see through the film. The second is that of the relationship between the audio and the visual elements: we are able to ‘see’ the narrator standing in a field as he describes, shouting absurdities into a microphone; we ‘see’ the material conditions of this production as a performance of a speaker juxtaposed with a spatially distant image. The third is at the level of fiction, and we are able to suspend our disbelief and see the scene as one in which a man is escaping down a street having committed a robbery, in which birds have giant wingspans and people keep helicopters in their pockets. The triplicate properties of this transparent composite reveals a subsequent experience of each scene that would be invisible were they to be viewed separately.  The audience is able to simultaneously view all differing elements, as well as the space between them, and the manner in which they are entirely mediated by the director in such a way to carry a number of thoughts and intentions. In this way, it is possible to argue that, regardless of Scruton’s arguments, in many cases the cognitive economy of a cinematic image is in fact far greater than that of a painted scene or written line, given its capability to convey such a multiplicity of meaning via its transparent nature. \ In this essay I have argued that Scruton’s conception of film and photography as merely causal-dependent recording processes is limited and ignores important aesthetic potential. I have shown how Jonathan Friday and Dominic Lopes use Kendall Walton’s notion of ‘transparency’ in differing ways to disrupt the purely mechanistic relationship between the photograph and its object. Finally, I have explored how, via an understanding of film as transparent, we can demonstrate that there exists within it representative capability that is unique to the medium. \ In this essay, I propose to consider Jacques Derrida’s ‘Aphorism Countertime’ and Derrida’s use of the proper name within it as a means to explore various aspects of desire within Shakespeare’s ‘Romeo and Juliet’, as well as more broadly to make claims about the nature of desire and love in general. I will do this primarily by using Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s essay ‘Love Me, Love My Ombre, Elle’ as a means to remain attuned to Derrida’s exploration of sexual difference and the gender binary within his text, as well as the relationship of this to the act and scene of writing, and the manner in which his text is caught within the processes it describes. I will go on to argue that Juliet uses the power of the name as a means to escape from the patriarchal structures within which she is caught, and in doing so advocate a new, radically egalitarian identity that is built upon her love for Romeo and his for her. I will show how previous readings of the text, and specifically psychoanalytic interpretations of death within the play, fail to appreciate this act of meta-textual authorship that occurs within it, and the relationship of figurative deaths with literal lives. I will conclude my essay by looking at the instances of what we might consider the ‘inhumanity or the ahumanity’ (“Aphorism Countertime, 136) of the name and of language more broadly, and how the pathetic weight of the play aims to transcend this obstacle as it is placed before its characters and the audience. \ 	The form that Derrida has chosen for his essay, a series of aphoristic or pseudo-aphoristic statements or sections, begins in that sets out to establish a set of first principles and then expands from there. Thus, in the beginning, we have: ‘1. Aphorism is the name.’ (127). As he introduces ‘Romeo and Juliet’ into this set of principles, folding them in so to speak, he focuses upon the way in which the two communicate with and join one another. They occur in Derrida’s text, as they did in Shakespeare’s, as a part of a ‘serial logic’: their names both stand aphoristically for an entire set of connotations, histories, myths, as they do for the characters in any given rendition of the story, or any performance thereof. In this way we may say that they ‘will have lived and lived on [auront survécu], through aphorism’ (128). They are not ‘themselves’. We see here already a tension established that Derrida will return to at length later in the piece: we cannot simply approach these characters as if they remain isolated or tied to this one particular play, and halt our analysis at that; the very nature of their being, tied as it is to aphoristic sentiment, transcends and is removed from them. He moves us from the particular to the general, but in such a way that doesn’t attempt to make sweeping statements encompassing false universalities. Instead, we are looking at aphorisms, these aphorisms, their relationship to each other, how they fit within a wider signifying chain. \ The aim and effect of this, which I will explore further below, is summed in aphorism 11: ‘the survival of a theatrical work implies that, theatrically, it is saying something about theatre itself, about its essential possibility. And that it does so, theatrically, then, through the play of uniqueness and repetition, by giving rise every time to the chance of an absolutely singular event as it does to the untranslatable idiom of a proper name’ (129). The instances of individual differentiation, the unique circumstances that Derrida analyses, in this way give rise to an understanding of the wider whole. Each acts as a small reflection, through which each other may be seen, in a manner akin to Indra’s Net. It is thus through careful analysis of these particular characters, aphorisms, and the relationships they have to one another, that Derrida means to make some astute observations about ontology and language more generally. \ 	But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Before he reaches this conclusion in its entirety, Derrida undertakes the motions of an inquiry into desire and love as it occurs within the play. This is marked for him by a primary ‘disjunction’ (129); one that serves to create distance between its participants even as it appears to bind them together. The desire here can only occur via an interaction with the aphorisms, the aphoristic names that he mentions in aphorism 1. Derrida takes the concept of this love, which Juliet spells out in the scene he analyses, and pushes the language to its sensible limit in order to determine exactly what it is that Juliet loves, and in fact what in her is projecting this love. We arrive at a split between the person in and of themselves, and their name; a separation that Derrida marks textually as Romeo (that is, Romeo himself, the flesh-and-blood person, his interiority or, conversely, his soul), and ”Romeo” (the linguistic name attached to him, that signifier through which he in engaged with the world around him, including all of its familial politics). Although the two may appear to coincide—after all, what does a name name if not the object to which it’s attached?—but for Derrida this is a false assumption. The link is not only arbitrary, but in fact approaching it as if it were a naturalistic connection serves to disguise the nature of the interaction between the interior and exterior personages to which it is ascribed: in this way, ‘contretemps is produced at the intersection between interior experience (the “phenomenology of internal time-consciousness,” or space-consciousness) and its chronological or topographical marks, those which are said to be “objective,” “in the world”.’ (131). \ 	Within this schema, we are as people then dual-selves; we are comprised of that which, ‘inside’, we consider to be us, and that name to which, ‘outside’, we are ascribed and associated with. This has large implications for Romeo and Juliet’s relationship with one another. For not only does Derrida draw a separation between this interior and exterior self, but he also argues that one can only know another’s exterior, their name, their aphorism. It is in this way that he says ‘I love because the other is the other, because his or her time will never be mine. The living duration, the very presence of the other’s love remains infinitely distant from mine, distant from itself in what stretches it toward mine’ (131). The separation is doubled: the other remains removed from both the love that I experience of them and from me in myself. This is the truth that Derrida points to at the heart of our names, as exemplified in the play when Juliet says: ‘What’s in a name? That which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet; […] Romeo, doff thy name; / And for thy name, which is no part of thee, / Take all myself’ (Shakespeare, II, ii, 43-49). And yet as becomes clear within the play, it is not as straightforward as saying that one’s name is no part of oneself. It is not merely a ‘title’ (“Aphorism Countertime”, 137), but in fact the very reason they are able to love each other, the ‘fortuitous contretemps’ (130) that marks ‘the conjunction of two desires’. Hence, Romeo ‘has not been able to set himself free from his name’ (135); ‘he, his living self, living and singular desire, he is not “Romeo”, but the separation’ marked by that aphoristic name. It facilitates their love even as it separates them. \ 	This brings us to the question of sexual difference within this aphorism-name relationship. For, as Derrida notes, the manner in which desire and names relate within the play is not a symmetrical one across the gender divide. ‘The dissymmetry remains infinite’ (138), both in terms of what Juliet asks Romeo to give up to experience her love, and in terms of what he is able to give up that she isn’t. For, due to the genealogical nature of naming, Romeo, as a man, has a ‘double bind that ties a son to the name of his father’ (139). Juliet, as a woman, does not have this privilege, and even if she were to give up her name for Romeo, this would fall within the bounds of a typical, socially expected heteronormative marriage and thus would not be perceived as a real loss in the same sense. Gayatri Spivak draws attention to this vein in Derrida’s work in the following way:  \ [His] critique of legitimation through the patriarchal proper name can be appreciated in the most common-sensical way. The Western metaphysics of everyday life does indeed make a woman’s name undecidable. It is either her father’s or her husband’s. What is her “own” name? She make take her mother’s father’s or create a fictive name which does not effectively threaten the circuit of legitimacy. \ 							(Spivak, 23, note 7) \ Thus, Juliet does not own her name, either “Juliet” or “Capulet”, in the same way that Romeo owns “Romeo” and “Montague”. She is excluded from this genealogy by the patriarchal structures that govern it due to her gender. This is why Derrida outlines the law of the name thus: ‘the name of the father should be kept by the son, and it is from him that there is some sense in tearing it away, and not at all from the daughter, into whose keeping it has never come’ (139). \ 	This asymmetry is however the reason why Juliet proves to be the locus of critique regarding the law of the name, both within the play and in Derrida’s examination of it. If we turn back to Spivak, we can see the reason for this. She argues that ‘to see indeterminacy in the figure of women might be the effect of an ethicolegal narrative whose oppressive hegemony still remains largely unquestioned’ (22). But, in the work she is examining, Derrida’s critique of Nietzsche and Stéphane Mallarmé, precisely the opposite occurs: ‘the deduction allows [his reading] to make woman the mark of the critique of the proper.’ Following on from this she says that:  \ If the word “woman” can thus be associated with the narrative of this set of problems […] it is perhaps the most tenacious name for the limit that situates and undermines the vanguard of every theory seeking to be adequate to its theme. The limit is where the proper becomes undecidable, is put within the double (or indefinite) mirror-structure of the abyme: […] Derrida’s arrival at the name of woman seems to be a slow assumption of the consequences of a critique of humanism as phallocentrism. \ 							(Spivak, 23-4) \ Working under this premise means the recognition that the majority of the Western philosophical canon until this point has been, in its construction, rooted in patriarchal assumptions that delineate man as the neuter, the assumed universal personage, and woman as the other. And Spivak points out that it is not in his explicit arguments that this becomes clear, but rather in those ‘slowly assumed consequences’ that occur when one continues his body of thought to its conclusion. She compares this movement to that of Derrida’s own critique of Edmund Hussel’s logocentric assumptions in Of Grammatology, in that for Derrida the name of ‘woman’ marks a limit pertaining to the ‘pre-institutional origin’ (24) of ‘the institution of the metaphysical tradition’. It is literally an assumption that predates any other set of first principles that may be extolled from the dawn of the canon and thus threatens to undermine the resulting chains of thought. \ 	If we revisit the play in light of this, we can see how Juliet’s attempts to discard the old aphoristic ties of the couple’s individual names as they were prior to their union, in favour of a new shared existence, is in fact a much more radical statement than it first appears. This is picked up by Derrida in aphorism 12 when he draws attention to ‘Romeo and Juliet, the conjunction of two desires that are aphoristic but held together, […] a promise in their name, but across and beyond their given name, the promise of another name’ (130). For Juliet does not want to discard those names, to leave them nameless. It is ‘the and of this conjunction’ which is key here. In the failure to bridge Romeo and Juliet, to transcend the interior/exterior divide, she can instead bridge “Romeo” and “Juliet” that renders their desire for one another a single, unified entity which marks them as whole. This is why, for Derrida, the various contretemps of the play are not accidental, are not merely the result of a series of chance encounters. The play is structured around this encounter which has always already occurred, that orients the drama in a way that transcends the temporal logic of its sequencing. \ 	Stephen A. Shapiro notes of the centrality of contradiction and reversal to the play’s formal structure. He argues that the play itself can be divided more or less cleanly in two halves, with the first half being a romantic comedy, and the second a tragedy. This is for him hinged upon the central scene of the play, Act III, scene i, in which Tybalt is killed by Romeo. In this way ‘the play seems to be governed by the sacrificial deaths of Romeo and Juliet which reverse their parents’ hate’ (Shapiro, 499). It is not merely at the level of macroscopic narrative that these reversals and contradictions occur for Shapiro however; they also govern the couple’s relationship and, for Shapiro, the audience’s expected response to it. He says that, for us the audience, ‘the desire for perfect love, or perfect anything else, is fundamentally an unrealizable one—in life as we know it’ (500). Thus, we approach the couple’s naivety from a position of ambivalence, both willing it to succeed and knowing that it is doomed to fail. However, he remarks that the couple have in fact ‘achieved perfect communion, total absorption of self in the other’ (500-1), and that ‘we cannot help responding to this rare consummation’ (501). This explains the weight of the tragic finale: it provides for us a cathartic counter-balance to this occurrence that offers us the opportunity to sympathise with their love, ‘vicariously gratify our own desire for it, and simultaneously to react against it’. \ 	Shapiro’s psychoanalytic interpretation of the events of the play, and their intended responses, thus rather neatly explains how it is the play ‘”means”’ (499)—conveys its central message—via the utilisation of both form and content. I’ve used his essay as I feel that it provides us with one fairly typical response to the play and the couple’s love within it. I wish to counter this with some of the implications of the exploration of Spivak’s readings that I have conducted above. For Shapiro’s analysis, whilst convincing in many aspects, fails to escape the phallocentric limitations that direct one’s response to the play in terms of the gender binary within it. In this way, he sees Juliet admonishing the Friar that, should he fail to ‘remedy’ (Shakespeare, IV, i, 67) her situation, she’ll commit suicide, as being an example of ‘one of the most paradoxical and profound insights of psychoanalysis: a man is as much responsible for what is done to him as for what he does’ (Shapiro, 500). He views this death wish as merely the fulfilment of Juliet’s lot as a lover doomed to die, in a formal union of fate and fortune. \ 	What this view fails to attest to is that Juliet’s desire for Romeo transcends beyond the singular opposition of life/death as it applies to one’s mortal body. Her plans made with the Friar are that she and Romeo are to escape to Mantua, to literally escape the confines of the life that imprisons her within her family name, and via dying to reach a new life that has gone beyond the connotations of that title. There is, in this desire, a death to escape a greater death: that which she already is. For Juliet, in not having ownership over her own name, is forced into a kind of non-life. Her desire for Romeo is not so that he may rescue her or validate her name, where before she remained subservient to her father. Nor is it based within the hope of their losing their names altogether. Instead, she is proactive and assertive in her desire to forge a new name, a new aphorism that she and Romeo both co-habit and share. Her desire to escape her family is not only a desire to escape a patriarchal authority, it is in fact a radical egalitarian attempt to subvert the structures that subordinate women to men and instead form a new identity. Via this death, Juliet attempts to reach a new life. \ 	We might ask the question of what it matters who holds the power of the name. It could well be argued that it holds and incidental place within the broader themes of Shakespeare’s play, and that there are other more pressing aspects to attend to if we are to attempt a feminist reading of its events. However, I turn to Carol Clarkson and her defence of focusing on names: ‘questions about names in the novel broach questions about human identity – about the ways in which personal identities are imbricated in social, cultural, and national identities. […] I would argue that this is true of many other literary works, making it possible to develop an ethics based on the naming events in fiction’ (Clarkson, 45). When we ask questions about the name, we necessarily also implicate those varying ulterior concerns that are attached to it as she outlines. When we pursue Juliet’s name thus, we find ourselves at a crossroads that joins her personal identity with that of the wider expectations placed upon her by those in her social group. The power to name is invariably the power of authorship, and the power of a wider autonomy. \ 	There is, in Shakespeare’s play, the story of another Romeo and Juliet, one in which they are able to fulfil their secret marriage and escape the names of their families. Derrida has written elsewhere of secret languages and the power that their custodians hold. Suffice it to say that Juliet’s attempts to name, to reclaim a name for herself and for her love, situate her in a position of power within the text that goes beyond that of a star-crossed lover wishing to elope with her husband. For Derrida notes in aphorism 23 the situation she is placed in by her name and its implications: ‘when she says to him: my enemy is only your name, she does not think “my” enemy. Juliet, herself, has nothing against the name of Romeo. It is the name that she bears (Juliet and Capulet) that finds itself at war with the name of Romeo. The war takes places between the names’ (136). There is here the separation of voices that mark a site of internal conflict that, in many ways silently, divides Juliet from herself. The name “Juliet Capulet” is speaking through her: she is rendered inarticulate by the name whose meaning supersedes her personal feelings and places her at odds with the man she loves. It is in this sense that we should see Juliet’s attempt to create a new name as an act of autonomous authorship. She looks to kill that which within her is nevertheless outside of herself, is at odds with herself, that “Juliet” who is at war with “Romeo”. \ 	 When the actual deaths occur within the play, we find a strange thing occurring. Thomas Moisan has written about the unusual rhetoric that marks the ‘lamentations’ scene that follows it in Act IV of the play which, in its ‘excessive’ (Moisan, 389) nature ‘gets in our way’ when we try to truly experience the full pathos that the scene should carry. This is tied to what he sees as Shakespeare’s attempts to ‘undercut the rhetoric of grief’ (390) via maintaining an ironic distance and exonerate, by implication, the full and genuine emotions felt by Romeo and Juliet. Going further than this, he also points to this technique within the text as a means to ‘retreat from, the issue of death’, to subsume the explicit implications of the finale’s proximity with death and instead relocate the heart of the tragedy to the implicit, unsaid aspects of the drama that the closing dialogue serves only to ‘mediate’, ‘hinting’ at it. The examples he gives are of the various characters’ speeches and their generally introspective, self-pitying qualities that foreclose a response of genuine emotion or grief. He also notes the formal reversals that Shakespeare uses in order to heighten the ironic effect, for example how in the Nurse’s dialogue we hear the ‘mournful transmogrification of the earlier speech, its digressive and reiterative reprise of past happiness turned into an equally formless acknowledgement of present pain’ (396). \ 	The overall effect of this use of rhetorical distancing is, I argue, to go a little further than Moisan’s assessment that it allows the play to avoid the explicit exposure of the death of its two protagonists. For, if as Moisan argues, it is via this movement that death is made truly present, unlike elsewhere in the play where its evocation serves to ‘disarm it of its sting by accepting it as an indisputable condition of life’ (392), could it not also be argued that a similar effect is being produced with regards to the death implicit in the naming functions of the play? When Derrida talks of ‘the inhumanity or the ahumanity of the name’ (“Aphorism Countertime”, 136), do we not see evidence of that same ‘silence’ (Moisan, 404) that characterises a presence through absence? The third set of “Romeo”s and “Juliet”s that we have encountered in this play, those of the names, who remain silent and yet orientate the action of the scenes around them. These spectral presences are the true antagonists of the narrative. In wanting to rename, Juliet means to defer the deaths promised in these names, escape from the ahuman insistence of their hold upon her. \ 	In this way, when Clarkson talks about the ‘contemporary philosophical investigations about proper names’ (Clarkson, 44), we begin to see how ‘Romeo and Juliet’ demonstrates the kind of self-reflexive theatricality that says something about the ‘essential possibility’ (“Aphorism Countertime”, 129) of theatre itself. This goes some way toward helping us understand Derrida’s choice of the play as a means to explore ideas related to ontology and language more broadly. For Juliet’s use of the name is, I argue, a performative function that serves to create for her a new personage outside of the text, even as she fails to achieve within the bounds of the narrative. And yet this Juliet what not be what she is without ‘all the Romeo and Juliets’ (128) that came before this play. So, while she is unable within the narrative to escape the bonds of her name, she is simultaneously reliant entirely on the fact that she has already done so in order to facilitate her creation. Shakespeare’s play takes part in an extended aphoristic chain which, via his skilful use of dramatic forms, is implicated within the webs of signification it describes. We see here what Spivak talks about when she asks ‘what happens when we read theoretical texts as itineraries of desire? Not a “rejection” of theory, but a recognition that it is subject to production and that therefore its use-value is not simply theoretical […] the author is caught in and enabled by the same net as other men’ (Spivak, 30). If we attest ourselves to the scene of writing, we can recognise how this play is as implicated within these same aphoristic chains as Derrida is in his writing upon them, and as subsequent writers upon both remain. \ 	This is where I feel Clarkson’s ethics based on the naming events in fiction’ (Clarkson, 45) truly resides. For, in implicating us the readers or audience of the play within the aphoristic series of naming events, Shakespeare’s play forces us to be proactive in our reflections on the moral difficulties faced by its characters. We cannot simply ignore the effects of the drama that unfolds before us. Derrida’s readings of course point us towards fruitful avenues to pursue within the text, but they do not add to anything that is not already latent within it. Instead, what he demonstrates is the ability for theory to locate within works of art methods through which we might advocate and further our own ethical practices in our daily lives, as well as deepening our understanding of aesthetic considerations. This is, I feel, what Spivak means when she advocates an ‘affirmative deconstruction’ (Spivak, 24). She says that this sort of project ‘is concerned with forging a practice that recognizes the condition of possibility in the impossibility of theoretical rigor, and that must remain apocalyptic in scope and tone’ (25). Derrida does not allow us to grow comfortable with our assumptions and preconceptions; instead we are forced through his reading to re-assess our own underlying biases and determine how we are to navigate ourselves around the issues raised in such a way that remains self-conscious of our own fallibility. \ 	In the case of gender, the simple act of redefining one’s name takes on new significance in this light, as we realise the full range of social constraints and expectations that remain foundational to something it is easy to ascribe to a naturalistic part of us. In such small ways, the undermining of large monolithic structures such as a patriarchal philosophical canon, are shown to be capable of subversion and rectification. This productive, deconstructive engagement with text is one of the gesture’s enduring legacies. \ 	In this essay I have attempted to demonstrate how the proper name is used as a bridge between interiority and exteriority, with the simultaneous effect of distancing and unifying disparate desires, in ‘Romeo and Juliet’ and Jacques Derrida’s interpretation of it. I have shown how the proper name points to a fundamental disunity in the characters of the play, and how this disunity is one that is gendered and affects people differently across the gender binary. I have explored Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s reading of the name of woman within Derrida, and attempted to use her insights in order to guide my own interpretation of his readings of the play. In this way, I have argued that Juliet lies at the centre of the play’s subversive and emancipatory critical power, as she is the character most affected by the gendered disunity of the proper name, and it is she who attempts to find an avenue to move beyond this. I have shown how previous psychoanalytic readings of the play fail to take into account this strength of character, and that the formal methods through which Shakespeare affects his critical powers go beyond those articulated by these critics. I have argued that it is via the continuation of the aphoristic chain that we might locate the ethical crux of the play and that it is here both Shakespeare and Derrida engage with their audiences in a larger deconstructive project. \ In this essay I wish to conduct a close reading of two scenes from Francis Ford Coppola’s film The Conversation, in light of two texts written by Roland Barthes: “An Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative”, and S/Z. In doing so, I wish to ask the question of how Barthes’ Structuralist approach to narrative opens up interpretation to us in ways that might otherwise be overlooked, given the film’s textual complexity and the multiplicity of its interpretations. Dennis Turner notes that the film’s ‘accumulation of inexplicable data has led certain critics to argue that it isn’t possible to tell exactly what is going on in The Conversation’ (8); I hope that by using Barthes we may be able to overcome this criticism to some degree. I will first conduct a close reading of the film’s party scene, in light of S/Z and using its methodology to provide a framework for my approach. In doing so, I will argue that Barthes allows us to effectively track a number of simultaneous elements that are being explored and developed by Coppola within the scene, and that his approach is able to elucidate, rather than restrict, it’s meaning. Following this, I will conduct a second close reading of the scene that follows the party, in which we see the film’s protagonist Harry Caule engage with a kind of narrative intertextuality within the confines of the film. I will conduct this via the use of Barthes’ methodology laid out in “Structural Analysis”. \ 	Peggy Rosenthal sees Barthes as ‘reacting to the method of some structuralist literary criticism, as developed […] by Barthes himself in an essay like “An Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative”’ (128), in which she says he attempts narrative analysis by ‘operating on a different level than the text itself’, focusing on ‘abstracting meanings from the text […] instead of seeing how meanings operate in it’. Due to this, I will maintain throughout my second reading an awareness of the limits of Barthes’ approach in this essay, and will attempt to maintain some of the changes in thought that occurred within S/Z. I hope that, by using the two Barthes texts in conversation with each other, as argued by Rosenthal, my own reading of the narrative of The Conversation, which I will argue speaks to itself at points via its characters, will be further enriched in this way. \ There are two primary enigmas within the film that I wish to consider via Barthes schema of ‘cardinal functions’ (“Structural Analysis” 248). The first forms the opening mystery of the film: the conversation itself, and the question of what the words of the two targets, Mark and Ann, mean. This is formulated for us by the character of Stan, talking to Harry in the van from which they’re directing the operation. He asks Harry ‘who’s interesting in these two anyway?’ to which Harry replies with a series of ‘I don’t know’s. Stan ends the exchange with the observation ‘sometimes it’s nice to know what they’re talking about’, setting up for us the enigma. The second enigma that serves as a cardinal function comes in the form of Harry himself. We learn early on that he is an extremely private man via three scenes: he becomes very agitated with his landlady for letting herself into his apartment to leave him a birthday present; he lies about his profession to his girlfriend Amy, and becomes angry when she keeps asking him questions; he loses his temper with Stan who, noticing his partner’s strange obsession with the tapes, asks him what’s wrong and why he’s so concerned about them. In short, there seems to be some missing detail that unifies this behaviour, which we may formulate as ‘what is Harry hiding?’. In the pursuit of answers to both of these enigmas, the narrative eventually unifies them, and in the resulting milieu the one cannot be answered without reference to the other, as I will show below. \ 	In my reading of the first scene under consideration, my approach will emulate the method Barthes espouses in S/Z, and deconstruct the scene via his ‘step-by-step method’ (S/Z 12), though in order to keep it concise, I will attune my reading to a few particular features that within the scene, rather than conduct an enquiry to the same level of detail that Barthes accomplishes. I will, in this way, divide it into lexias that, whilst remaining like Barthes’ divisions ‘arbitrary in the extreme’ (S/Z 13), will I hope elucidate certain aspects of the narrative as they develop. I will also use four of the five codes drawn up within S/Z to signify different elements: HER, for the text’s hermeneutic code; SEM, for its semes; SYM, for the symbolic meanings implicit in certain elements; ACT, for the chain of actions as they occur. The fifth code Barthes uses, REF, for the meanings or knowledge external to the text to which it refers, will remain absent from my reading for the sake of brevity, though this does of course leave it vulnerable to accusations of partiality in its conclusions. I hope however, that by keeping these modest in scope and confined to the internal logic of the text itself, the omission will prove to be slight. Given that this is a film under consideration, rather than a written text, I will summarise each section with a brief description of what occurs, and any dialogue I wish to examine, before beginning my analysis of each. \ ⦁	The men run laughing through the warehouse toward the locked workshop gate. Bernie: ‘Want me to pick that lock for you Harry?’ The guests enter the workshop, and begin playing music. Harry locks away a series of papers related to his work. * We begin the scene with a largely jovial atmosphere, the participants are already a little drunk following a car chase prior to this scene. Bernie’s remark appears at this stage to be friendly and amiable, simply a joke between men in the same profession. Any sense of malice is lost within the laughter of the company (SEM. Profession). ** Harry’s locking away of the papers sets the groundwork for one of the primary dynamics that occurs within the scene: the concealment of information, and the attempt to reveal this information by various characters (SYM. Concealment: locking away). \ ⦁	Bernie: ‘Here’s to Harry, the best bar none. I’ll drink to that.’ Harry: ‘The best what?’ Bernie: ‘The best bugger on the West Coast!’ * In this exchange, we learn an important piece of information about our protagonist that had been hinted at previously in the film when Harry is well known amongst the attendees of a large security convention. Whilst we have assumed until this point that Harry is good at his job, as he is able to successfully orchestrate a team throughout a complex operation at the start of the film, here we are told of his reputation explicitly (HER: Enigma: 1: Harry’s reputation). ** (SEM. Profession: The best). \ ⦁	Bernie: ‘You know it’s really funny we never bumped into each other in New York Harry.’ Stan: ‘Hey I didn’t know you came from New York Harry.’ Bernie: ‘Are you kidding? Harry’s famous in New York.’ * We learn a further piece of information regarding Harry’s past, and that he never mentioned this to his partner Stan. This intensifies the enigma as the viewer is left to piece together why he concealed this piece of information (HER: Enigma: 1: Harry’s past). \ ⦁	Bernie: ‘You know the only one I couldn’t figure out though Harry? The welfare fund, back in ’68.’ Harry: ‘How’d you know about that?’ Bernie: ‘Everybody in the biz knew about it. But nobody knows how you did it though Harry.’ Bernie remains looking at Harry, and makes a sound of inquiry. Harry looks away smirking, then down to his drink, then back to Bernie, making a small shrug and looking away again. * Harry is playful in response to Bernie’s enquiry, with Gene Hackman conveying a multitude of subtle movements of his face and posture to convey a number of things: Harry’s inability to maintain eye contact, demonstrates his discomfort; his lips open slightly and his tongue is visibly pushed against his teeth; he flits between an embarrassed grin and an anxious frown. Throughout this Bernie remains calm, collected, with his eyes locked on Harry’s face. Bernie has both revealed to Harry that he knows more about him than Harry thought (posing the further question, what else does he know?) and simultaneously began trying to extract a piece of information from him (ACT. Interrogation: 1: ‘68 welfare fund). \ ⦁	Harry dances with Meredith, who appears drunk. Bernie regales the story of his first phone-tap. The three of them listen into a phone call being made by Stan and Paul. Following this, the camera follows Harry walking away, leaving Bernie at the edge of the shot, slowly being panned out. Bernie: ‘When are you going to get a new scrambler Harry? This one went out with the Trojan War.’ * Meredith feigns drunkenness at this point, which lulls both Harry and the audience into a false perception that she is harmless, ditsy, an otherwise good and trustworthy character amongst potentially dangerous or unscrupulous company (SEM. Innocence). ** Bernie’s criticism comes from out of shot; it hangs as if from a disembodied voice and Harry does not respond or acknowledge it, despite hearing it. Bernie’s is the first of a series of small criticisms that mount in frequency and ubiquity throughout the scene (SYM. Antithesis: Praise/Criticism). \ ⦁	Meredith pulls Harry out of the office and into the warehouse, saying she wants him to tell her about himself. Bernie [carrying on]: ‘Really obsolete, you know that Harry?’ Paul: ‘Harry got himself a girlfriend…’ Stan: ‘Watch out Harry!’ * The criticisms and jibes appear unseen by the audience. Bernie’s back is turned to the camera as he speaks, and Stan and Paul are out of shot when we hear their voices. Coppola here begins proper the shift from a naturalistic scene to a more subjective and ambiguous one, in which the voices we hear increasingly begin to seem like a disembodied mass that follow Harry hidden from those around him. As they build they are internalised and the audience is made privy to this aspect of Harry’s psyche (SYM. Disembodied voices: Criticism) ** HER. Enigma: 1: Harry’s guilt. \ ⦁	Meredith tells Harry a story of her failed marriage in New York. The camera cuts between a wide shot of the two of them in the warehouse, to a medium shot of Meredith talking and smiling, to a wide shot of Harry alone under a spotlight at the side of the frame, with the bare warehouse behind him. Harry dodges a question about where he lives. The camera cuts behind Harry with Meredith in the background, and she walks towards Harry and joins him in the foreground. Meredith: ‘I wish that you’d feel you could talk to me, and that we could be friends.’ * Meredith’s sad story, as well as Elizabeth MacRae’s lack of balance in her movements, the way she moves close to Harry and touches him gently, conveys again that she is caring, safe, loving towards him. Harry and the audience are lulled into thinking she is an innocent and trustworthy character (SEM. Innocence). ** Coppola here uses the camera to visually represent Harry’s sense of isolation from those around him. Meredith is playfully swinging on a pillar, and the proximity of the camera brings her close to the audience. We are able to see the details of her appearance, and she seems in this way open to the both us and to Harry. The wide shot of Harry alone however marks a stark contrast: he is small in the shot, the spot light above him casts most of his body in shadow, the warehouse behind him is vast and empty, itself also in semi-darkness. At once Harry is partially concealed from us, and simultaneously it is suggested visually that it is he himself who imposes this isolation, as the camera work echoes his silence and deflection of Meredith’s question (SYM. Concealment: isolation). \ ⦁	The camera cuts to a close-up of Harry and Meredith, with Harry facing the camera and his back against a pillar. Harry begins asking Meredith a euphemistic series of questions about a girl, waiting for a man she loved but who was distant. The music of the party fades and instead a piano piece from the film’s score begins. The camera three times cuts behind Harry, then pans slowly around the couple until he is facing the camera, whilst he continues talking. * Harry here reveals that he is afraid that he has lost the woman he loved, Amy, because of his own inability to open up to her. The piece of music that plays is titled “Amy’s Theme” (Shire track 8), and is the same track that plays in the earlier scene where Harry leaves her apartment because she asks him questions about himself. In this way, Coppola audibly links the current scene of intimacy to the previous one, and draws attention to the change that has occurred in the time between this juxtaposition: in the first, we see Harry getting angry with Amy but we don’t know why, and the audience identifies with her character because it is placed in the same position of unknowing as she is; in this scene, Harry opens up to both Meredith and the audience, and instead we identify with him as the narrative shifts toward depicting his inner thoughts. The close camera-work furthers this by isolating the two characters from the rest of the party, visually representing that the narrative has temporarily entered Harry’s subjective interior state (HER. Enigma: 1: Harry’s fear of intimacy). ** SYM. Concealment: slight reveal. \ ⦁	The quiet scene is interrupted by the roar of Stan’s moped off-screen. The camera cuts wide and slowly pans backwards, with Harry and Meredith in the middle of shot, and Stan and Paul circling them on a moped. Stan returns to the office and stands alone, staring at a sign in front of him. The music is cut off by Bernie’s voice, as he suddenly appears in shot and begins boasting about his abilities. Paul, Stan, and Millard appear within shot, surrounding Harry, while Stan tells a story of how Harry once put a bug inside a parakeet. Bernie: ‘Parakeets don’t happen to be my thing Harry, but I sure would like to know how you did the teamster local back in ‘68’. * ACT. Interrogation: 2: reiteration. ** Stan’s story suggests a quiet ruthlessness in Harry’s work ethic. We are reminded that his work is invasive and that he is not an innocent party (SEM. Profession: dirty work). \ ⦁	 Bernie recounts the story of the teamster job. As he does so, Harry, looking angry, walks off across the office to get a drink. Bernie follows as he talks, and the camera follows with him, with Harry leading the shot. The blame comes to rest with Bernie in the foreground, back turned, and Harry in the background, facing the camera, with a translucent plastic screen between him and Bernie/the camera. * In this shot we are once again brought into Harry’s interior perception. As Bernie retells the story of a job that obviously upsets him, we see how he is literally chased by it, with the details becoming public despite Harry’s attempt to keep them private. As the camera pans with the pair, the audience too is made complicit in this, as we are made voyeurs to the uncovering of Harry’s past. The screen Harry places between himself and Bernie/the audience once again visually represents his attempts to isolate himself from those around him and, it would seem, his own actions. The audience is made aware that no-one is clear of responsibility, via their involvement in this voyeurism (HER. Enigma: 1: Harry’s past). ** ACT. Interrogation: 3: persistence. *** SYM. Concealment: exposure. \ ⦁	 Bernie: ‘That boat was bug-proof. I happen to know that for a fact […] that didn’t stop Harry though, did it? No, he recorded everything.’ * Bernie here mixes praise for Harry’s professional skill, with a dehumanising gesture of talking at him, of narrating him, rather than talking to him. This serves the dual-purpose of providing verbal exposition to the audience, whilst at the same time subtly undermining Harry’s control of his own narrative, and continuing the struggle of power between the two men (ACT. Interrogation: 4: narration). ** SYM. Disembodied voices: punishment. \ ⦁	 Bernie: ‘Caused a hell of a scandal too.’ Stan: ‘Why?’ Bernie: ‘Why? No reason. Three people were murdered, that’s all. Harry’s a bit too “modest” to tell us how he did it though.’ Bernie goes on to list the brutal details of the murder, whilst Harry, sighing, walks out of the office and round the wire cage to a bin on the outside of it. Bernie: ‘Come on Harry, show and tell. How’d you do it?’ Paul: ‘For God’s sake Harry, tell him!’ * Bernie’s inquiry, which until this moment could have been ascribed to professional jealousy, now takes a malicious and sadistic turn. He revels in exposing the level of violence that resulted from Harry’s actions to the other characters in the party, nonchalantly detailing the cruelty inflicted, all the while seemingly following Harry along with the camera that pans to track his attempt to escape (ACT. Interrogation: 5: murdered victims). ** HER. Enigma: 1: Harry’s secret. *** SYM. Concealment: total exposure. \ ⦁	 Stan interrupts this moment by playing the tape Harry recorded for the recent job. Harry responds angrily, throwing a plastic bin at him and shouting at him to turn it off. Bernie: ‘What was that, Stan?’ Stan: ‘Well, it’s the assignment that Harry did this week. It’ll make history.’ Bernie: ‘I could figure out any of Harry’s schemes, right? Come on, try me.’ Stan takes Bernie through the details of the job, and Bernie fails to determine how Harry carried it out. Harry cuts in and reveals with pride how he achieved it. * We see Harry act here unlike any other point of the film. He suddenly appears extroverted and authoritative: he strolls towards the camera, putting his arm first around Paul and then around Meredith; he’s smiling and laughing, all the while talking quickly and excitedly about his work, gesturing with his arms and hands. He even opens the locked part of the office to give Bernie a peek at one of his custom-built microphones (SEM. Profession: Pride). ** HER. Enigma: 2: What the conversation means. \ ⦁	 Bernie offers Harry a partnership. Bernie: ‘I mean, I always said you’re the best, right? But you and me together, that’d be tops. All I need is a quick look at some of your plans and devices. You know, just to, just to get an idea.’ Harry deflects him with a joke. Bernie: ‘Made that up yourself, huh? That’s pretty funny. [To Stan] I’m talking about making millions he’s making with the jokes.’ Harry’s laughing, dancing with Meredith. Bernie: ‘How about going into a partnership Harry? I could use a partner; so could you.’ Harry: ‘I don’t need anyone.’ Bernie pulls from his jacket a tape reel, and plays back the recorded conversation Harry had held in private with Meredith moments earlier. The other’s crowd, laughing, in disbelief. Paul: ‘That’s terrific! The bugger got bugged, huh?’ * Harry’s short-lived confidence here is quickly dissolved as, spurned, Bernie turns on him with the same malice we saw moments before, in which he took pleasure in describing the vicious murders of the family (ACT. Interrogation: 6: rejected partnership). ** SEM. Antithesis: friendship/mockery. *** SYM. Concealment: eavesdropping. \ ⦁	 The tape plays out in full. The camera cuts between Bernie, laughing at Harry, with other characters walking in and out of shot laughing also, and Harry, shocked and silent, opening up the pen in his pocket that carried Bernie’s bug. Harry: ‘I think you’d better turn it off and get out!’ Bernie: ‘Are you kidding? It’s just a joke for Christ’s sake!’ Harry snaps the pen, and stands staring forward, looking between the floor and the elevator as the guests leave. Their voices cry out: ‘Good night Harry!’ * With the tender and most intimate moment exposed so openly, Harry is left a broken man. Norman K. Denzin argues that within the film:  \ Coppola shows that talk no longer matters. This is why Harry is so silent, […] why he never reveals who he really is. […] Talk is a commodity, an object that can be bought and sold. An object that can be copied and recorded. An object that can be dubbed, fashioned into a soundtrack, into a cluster of sentences that mean something’. (140) \ With this interpretation in mind, we can perhaps understand the full impact felt by Harry at having his words played back to him in this way. It is not only the exposure of his private thoughts and feelings to those around him that causes his anger, but it is the commodification of those things, the cheapening of their worth via the very technology he uses upon others. For a man who is so private and careful not to reveal anything about himself, we see here the confirmation of an anxiety that Harry may feel and that would explain his obsessive privacy: that deep down he feels his own thoughts and feelings are worth no more than those of the people that he records and sells. (ACT. Interrogation: 7: victory). ** SYM. Concealment: commodification. \ 	We have seen in this scene how, via a use of Barthes’ methodology, we have been able to draw out and analyse how Coppola constructs the scene in such a way as to blend Harry’s inner and outer worlds, to show the audience his fears and anxieties, whilst at the same time advancing the narrative and giving us large amounts of exposition on the plot that we have seen so far. Via his codes, we are able to see how the scene plays out in terms of the concealment and exposure of information, and how this movement affects the protagonist in his attempts to control it. In this way, the content of the film echoes Barthes’ conception of the composition of narrative itself: ‘language, Barthes insists, matters. It is a force (even, he’d say, the force) in the world, and if we don’t see this, we allow ourselves to be helpless victims of it’ (Rosenthal 136). We can use Rosenthal’s comment regarding Barthes to draw out a further conclusion about Harry Caul: his desperate attempts to control information, to conceal his secrets from the world and to maintain power over those he encounters, may well derive from the fear of becoming a victim himself. Having seen the power of information first hand, it comes as no surprise that Harry has developed enormous anxieties over falling prey to becoming merely a pawn in some larger course of events over which he has no power to act. We see this in his extreme anger at having been duped by Bernie. As he stands transfixed by the sound of his own voice being played back to him, Harry has lost any sense of agency within his own narrative. In exposing himself to Meredith, even a little, Harry has made an enormous gesture of opening himself up to the forces that drive both language and the ability to shape narrative; thus it takes only a small push from this position of vulnerability to completely unravel him. \ 	I wish now to move to the scene that follows the one above, in which Harry, having been humiliated, puts the tape recording the titular conversation on play, and lays in the bed in his office, whilst Meredith undresses and comes to join him. In this scene, I argue, we move fully from a depiction in which everyday reality is peppered with intrusions into Harry’s inner thoughts, into a far more ambiguous space where inner and outer worlds become thoroughly blended by Coppola. Rather than attempt a reading in the vein of S/Z, which would I think require a space far beyond the scope of this essay in order to fully account for the multiplicity of codes and effects that Coppola intersects, I will instead enact a more modest approach by considering the scene via Barthes’ partitions in “Structural Analysis”, and divide the narrative into ‘the level of “functions”’ (“Structural Analysis 243). However, my reading will remain informed by S/Z, and in particular Barthes’ emphasis on the difficulty in locating singular voices: ‘here, it is impossible to attribute an origin, a point of view, to the statement. Now, this impossibility is one of the ways in which the plural nature of the text can be appreciated. […] In modern texts, the voices are so treated that any reference is impossible: the discourse, or better, the language, speaks: nothing more’ (41). This plurality of voices is exactly what Coppola affects in this scene, as we shall see, and in attending to this later development in Barthes’ thought I hope to overcome one of the criticisms of “Structural Analysis” that, ‘while denying a crude mimetic model of literature, he seems to imply that there are kinds of discourse whose reference is unproblematic’ (Crosman 89). In this later work I think Barthes does satisfy Crosman’s view that the reader of texts is ‘caught in a web of interlocking frames of reference’ (92), and this I will show is present in Coppola’s shifting narration. \ 	The scene begins with Meredith turning out the lights of the office, plunging the already dim space into further darkness. Harry moves to the tape player at the back of his office, and begins replaying the tape of the recorded conversation, whilst Meredith attempts to pull him away from it, telling him to ‘come on. Come back. Turn it off’, before kissing him. Harry however is unable to leave the tapes, and we see before us a transformation of Harry from character within a narrative, to a reader outside of one. As the tape plays he comments upon it, telling Meredith (and, it should be said, the audience as well) ‘listen to the way she says “oh, God”’ and that ‘she’s frightened, this is where she’s frightened’. We see here Coppola blending both an ‘integrative’ unit (“Structural Analysis” 246) and a ‘distributive’ one, as can be expected within the ‘economy of the narrative’ (250) in such a dense scene. Harry’s actions as a reader serve two purposes in this regard. Firstly, as a distributive element, what Barthes terms a ‘cardinal function’ (248), i.e. a narrative element with a hinge-like property that ‘directly [affects] the continuation of the story’, this moment develops for us the pursuit of the enigma regarding what the taped conversation means; the resolution of which the entire plot drives towards. Harry’s reading of the content of the tape demonstrates its pliability, and the subtle saturation of its phrases with invested meaning slowly piece together the events that surround its creation and use. The interpretation Harry presents to us: ‘she’s frightened’, misdirects the audience as we follow the trail of signification in his footsteps, and like Harry we interpret this as meaning that the threat is directed against the two marks, rather than by them. \ 	In its ‘integrative’ capacity, we see how this misinterpretation of meaning provides for the audience a ‘vertically orientated’ (“Structural Analysis” 247) piece of narrative information. Harry’s liability here to hear fear in Ann’s voice, and to express his own fears that she will be harmed because of his actions, via his obsessive relaying and reading of the tapes, solidifies the fact that the teamster job referred to by Bernie has caused him serious psychological trauma. We are presented with an obvious disconnect between his disavowal of the event in the previous scene, in which he claims that ‘it had nothing to do with me, I just turned in the tapes’, with this reaction in which he fully invests himself in the outcome of his actions. This is further demonstrated when, in the midst of falling asleep, we hear Harry murmur ‘it’s true, a family was murdered because of me’, and ‘I have to destroy the tapes. I can’t let it happen again’. We are shown how Harry’s demons remain with him, something hinted at in an earlier scene in which he attends confession at his church. He tells the priest that he’s been involved in some work that he thinks ‘will be used to hurt these two young people’, and that it’s ‘happened to [him] before’ but he considers that he is ‘in no way responsible’. As Harry speaks, the camera, present with him in the confessional, slowly zooms past him to bring into focus the outline of the priest behind the gauze, listening and slowly nodding, before cutting to a CCTV screen display at the security conference he then attends. In this juxtaposition, Harry’s work and guilt are linked explicitly to the act of surveillance, and the technology he uses becomes an active participant in his act of narration. \ 	 The reader\arrative dynamic between Harry and the tape becomes extremely interesting when, as the scene develops, the gaze is reversed back upon him by the tape itself. As it plays, the tape reaches a segment recorded when the couple were standing over a homeless man asleep on a park bench. Ann begins with ‘oh, look: that’s terrible’, a comment that visibly draws Harry’s attention away from Meredith as he kisses her. Mark follows this with ‘he’s not hurting anyone’, a line referring to the homeless man, but which, as the scene unfolds is projected upon Harry. Ann responds to this by saying ‘neither are we’, and Harry is left staring at the tape, as if he is in mute dialogue with the couple: as he imagines them to be innocent lovers, just wanting to escape and to be together, so he frames himself as the agent preventing their love from being possible. Ann goes on: ‘he was once somebody’s baby boy, and he had a mother and a father who loved him, and now there he is half-dead on a park bench, and where are his mother or his father, all his uncles, now?’ As she finishes this line Harry is lying in bed, and the final light behind him goes out, leaving him illuminated by a single spotlight, with another lighting the tape player. The camera cuts between the two of them in a manner that emulates the traditional shot-reverse-shot sequencing of dialogue scenes within films. Coppola here plays with the convention of form in order to suggest the dialogue that’s implicitly occurring between Harry and the tape recording, or rather, the act of reading that’s taking place, as the words of the couple become reflections of Harry’s own state and his view of himself. \ 	In his documentary on psychoanalysis and film theory, The Pervert’s Guide to Cinema, Slavoj Žižek talks about the role of ‘the gaze’ within the bathroom scene that occurs later within The Conversation. He notes that in Harry’s inspection of the bathroom, he engages with two focal objects that return his gaze as he looks upon them: the toilet, and the hole at the bottom of the shower, an object which, in Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho, ‘is morphed into the eye, returning the gaze’ (Žižek). It is this notion that Žižek ascribes with providing the tension, and horror, of the long moments in which Harry stares at the toilet before he opens and flushes it, after which, clogged with tissues used to clean the room after the murder, it returns the blood it was concealing and spills out over the bathroom. Not only does the object physically conceal a terrible truth, it is also invested by Harry with the repressed knowledge of what he is about to uncover: in this event, as in his treatment of the past murders that resulted from his actions, he attempts to deny their existence for the sake of his sanity. This gives the object the capacity for the uncanny, loaded as it is in this way with ‘something that was long familiar to the psyche and was estranged from it only through being repressed’ (Freud 148). Much like the doll Olympia in “The Sandman” story that Freud analyses, so too this lifeless object seems to return Harry’s gaze and see through him, invested as it is with his own fears. Similar to this bathroom scene, this is the reason I argue that the tape recorder holds such power over Harry. 	This transformative act of reading, of elements in the narrative turning upon one another in order to gaze, is how Coppola affects his film’s self-reflexive genius. \ 	In my essay, I have attempted to show how The Conversation’s multiplicitous narrative structure can be explored via Barthes’ Structuralism. I have demonstrated how, in carrying out a reading like that of S/Z, we are able to examine the various levels at which the films narrative advances its plot and develops its protagonist. Following this, I have shown how by dividing the scene into distributive and integrative functions, we are all to see how Coppola blends these two aims within a single narrative movement. I have concluded by stating that the narrative incorporates both the gaze, and the act of reading, in order to disrupt traditional narratives, and extend meaning from a singular interpretation into wide variety of possibilities. \ In this essay I will argue for the case that the British government has, since the publication of the Prevent Strategy in 2011, placed at the core of its domestic public counter-terrorist initiatives an advocacy for what it terms ‘British values’, and, more broadly encompassing these, a ‘British identity’ to which all citizens should subscribe. I will demonstrate that this is especially the case with regards to British schools, as a part of the government’s aim to protect ‘vulnerable people’ (Carlile 55) from being ‘drawn into’ terrorist ideology and radicalisation. I will argue that the use of identity as the primary means to combat extremist ideology, rather than successfully extolling the virtues of our country, instead serves to target and marginalise ordinary Muslims and Muslim communities within the UK, and that this occurrence feeds into broader Islamophobic and racist discourses that are currently growing within Europe. Via a close reading of Stuart Hall’s ‘Cultural Identity and Diaspora’, I will attempt to show how the British government has established an essentialist, targeted, and highly politicised representation of ‘British identity’, and that its use as an ideological tool is extremely troubling given these recent trends. \ In November of 2014, the government released what it terms ‘non-statutory advice from the Department of Education’ (Promoting Fundamental British Values 3) in order to draw up guidelines for schools to promote what they call the ‘spiritual, moral, social and cultural (SMSC) development of their pupils’ (4). Within the paper, it is argued that it is part of a school’s compliance with section 78 of the Education Act 2002 that they ‘promote the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs’ (4), and that any attempt to undermine these values would be at odds with their legally-bound duty to provide SMSC. This necessity is linked within the paper to an earlier government publication released in 2011: the Prevent Strategy; a much longer and detailed piece and whose inclusion within Promoting ties schools into political anxieties regarding ‘terrorists born and bred in Britain’ (Carlile 1) that may emerge from ‘sectors and institutions where there are risks of radicalisation’. Indeed, although Promoting Fundamental British Values as Part of SMSC in Schools does not mention Islam by name at any point, its continued emphasis on matters of ‘faiths, races and cultures’ (4), as well as on making sure that pupils are ‘aware of the difference between the law of the land and religious law’, make it clear that its concerns are in line with Prevent Strategy’s aim to combat ‘Al Qa’ida and related groups’ (Carlile 16) in their attempts to ‘seek recruitment and radicalisation on a significant scale’. It sets out to reduce and reverse what is perceived as a risk of citizens adhering to religious doctrines that circumvent British law, and in this way lower the threat of future terrorist attacks within the UK. \ Both of these documents come against a background of an on-going shift in the way that the UK approaches questions of religious extremism amongst minority groups within it, as well as broader questions of cultural integration and harmony. In the foreword to the Prevent Strategy, Theresa May discusses the ‘flawed’ (Carlile 1) policies of New Labour inherited by the coalition government with regards to the Prevent programme. She notes that in the past, the programme ‘confused the delivery of Government policy to promote integration with Government policy to prevent terrorism’. She goes on to say that ‘we will do more than any other Government before us to promote integration’, but that this will be outside of the remit of the Prevent Strategy (2). However, it is via the ‘combined effect of this work that and of the new Prevent strategy’ that the government will launch an ‘unyielding fight against extremism’. \ The merging of these two aims in the past can be seen to have come from the historical background against which the UK’s multiculturalist policies were developed. Kenan Malik demonstrates how, following the series of riots that took place in Britain during the 1980s, beginning with the Brixton riot of 1981, ‘the then ruling Conservative government, led by Margaret Thatcher, wanted to reach out to immigrant communities [in order to address their causes] but was ill-placed to do so’ (50). He argues that it was the Labour-controlled local authorities that ‘possessed the moral currency to rebuild the inner cities’, and that it was via these and the subsequent Labour government headed by Tony Blair that the notions of racism and British identity became linked. In this way, addressing problems of community tensions and violence between groups demanded a redefinition of national identity and a consideration of Britishness as a whole:  \ The old idea of British values or a British identity was, the new municipal anti-racists argued, defunct. Rather than be expected to accept British values, or to adopt a British identity, different peoples should have the right to express their identities, explore their own histories, formulate their own values, pursue their own lifestyles. \ (50-51) \ This then culminated in the 2000 Parekh report, which Malik argues ‘has come to be seen as the defining essence of multiculturalism’ (52). \ If we view the current government’s initiatives in light of Malik’s writing, we are able to place its criticisms within the relevant context. Given this past merging of questions of national identity with those of inter-community integration, racism, and violence, we can see how in May’s criticisms she is attempting to spear-head a shift, and in many ways a reclamation, of British identity as something with a more positive definition. This is supported by the words of the Prime Minister David Cameron, in a speech made in 2011 that she refers to: ‘in the UK […] we have allowed the weakening of our collective identity. Under the doctrine of state multiculturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream’ (Cameron, PM’s Speech). He goes on to argue that ‘we need a lot less of the passive tolerance of recent years and much more active, muscular liberalism’. \ It is this second element which leads the way towards the use of British identity as a primary tool in counter-terrorism activities. The Prevent Strategy claims that ‘a stronger sense of ‘belonging’ and ‘citizenship’ makes communities more resilient to terrorist ideology and propagandists’ (27). The viewpoint is that, in recent years, the prevalence of multiculturalism in government policy has eroded the sense of British identity in Muslim communities across the country, and that as a result they have become more susceptible to extremist views. Thus to reverse this trend, what is needed is for a reaffirmation of British values in public rhetoric and government policy, particularly within ‘vulnerable’ groups, and thus security as a whole will be maintained. It is this fundamental contention that I take issue with, and that I will be examining more fully below. For now, I will simply conclude with a brief note regarding one reason why we should view this movement with scepticism, and why it should cause us concern. \ When discussing an article by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, titled ‘Down with Multiculturalism – Book Burning and Fatwas’, Chris Allen notes a similar thread in his criticism of multiculturalism to the one I have identified above. He notes that for Lamont, ‘a successful society requires obedience to the law’ (Allen para. 1.6), and that equally important is for minority groups to be seen as ‘expressing their allegiance both to the crown and also to a ‘British Identity’’. Setting aside the relevance of the monarchy, I’m interested in what Allen describes as an ‘amalgam of ideas [that] therefore becomes apparent’ in Lamont’s argument: \ The influence of ‘the Koran’, an obedience to the law, and number of things – weighted towards Islam and Muslims’ that would appear to present challenges to or exist against ‘our’ values […] Lamont demarcates and differentiates between those that he deems to have been able to become a part of the ‘British identity’, those that file past and respect the monarchy and those that exist outside that same ‘British identity’, those pronouncing fatwas, undertaking book-burnings and fighting against, rather than with, British troops […] As Lamont had so clearly demarcated, albeit not explicitly, which groups were placed exactly where, so the blame for multiculturalism’s failings and subsequent cause for its destructions was placed firmly, not at Blair and New Labour’s doors, but more accurately at Muslims’. \ (para. 1.6-7) \ It is this same shift that I see occurring within the rhetoric of Cameron’s calls for a more muscular liberalism. It is made explicit in the Prevent Strategy, that whilst there is a threat to the UK by terrorism related to Northern Ireland, and there have been convictions for acts committed by those on the extreme right-wing, ‘the most significant terrorist threat we face comes from Al Qa’ida, its affiliates, and like-minded terrorist organisations inspired by violent Islamism’ (13). It is this same threat which lies at the heart of Promoting British Values with regards to British schools. The assertion is that it is not, truly, multiculturalism in and of itself that is to blame for the current threat, but rather it is the failure of Muslim communities to properly integrate to ‘British society’ and thus it is their fault that these policies have failed. I am not contesting whether the government is correct in identifying violent Islamism as the largest terrorist threat to this country; rather I mean to draw attention to the same demarcation that Allen notes in Lamont’s article. I will now go on to examine cultural identity as a concept, and ask the question again of what problems arise in the government’s use of it as a means to counter terrorism, in light of my findings. I will also I hope demonstrate how the documents under consideration continue tying the dual aims of integration and combatting religious extremism together, even as it is claimed they are to be kept separate, and what this contradiction in rhetoric and methodology means when considering the impact upon the effected minority groups. \ 	In his essay ‘Cultural Identity and the Diaspora’, Stuart Hall argues that it may be useful to consider cultural identity as ‘a ‘production’ which is never complete, always in process, and always constituted within, not outside, representation’, (392) instead of as an ‘already accomplished fact’ which is fixed in a meaningfully tangible way. While he does acknowledge the usefulness of ‘imposing an imaginary coherence’ (394) upon fractured cultural narratives, particularly in the historical contexts of anti-colonial movements and third-world revolutions, he says that, from within the context of Caribbean experience, ‘we cannot speak for very long, with any exactness, about ‘one experience, one identity’, without acknowledging its other side – the ruptures and discontinuities which constitute, precisely, the Caribbean’s ‘uniqueness’’. For Hall then, far from being elements which undermine and annul cultural identities, breaks and fractures that occur within shared cultural experiences are defining features that contribute to their structure, even as they disrupt the possibility for singular cultural narratives. He goes on to detail some of the disparities that he sees as defining contemporary Caribbean identities, and sums them up broadly as being the ‘positioning and repositioning’ (398) of three ‘presences’: ‘Présence Africaine’, ‘Présence Européenne’, and ‘Présence Americaine’. By these, he means to draw attention to the three distinct geo-political areas that have together been constitutive of recent Caribbean history. The traces of these historical ‘presences’ are for Hall sufficient to allow him to speak broadly about this wide set of cultural experiences, though he does acknowledge that this approach is reductive and ignores the many other cultural ‘presences’ that have also been historically significant for the Caribbean. \ 	Without going too far into the specific geographic context of Hall’s argument, and by instead looking more broadly at his methodology and the larger implications for considering cultural identities, we can ask the question of how his approach opens up for us the British government’s recent writings upon the subject. I wish here to consider what I see as Hall’s primary thesis in his piece, which is that the outlining of cultural identity is always a practice of representation rather than definition, and that this practice subsequently serves to ‘implicate the positions from which we speak or write’ (393). Rather than create finite and all-encompassing cultural identities, Hall argues, we can do no more than produce a version of events and experience that, whilst we may try to render it as objectively as possible, remains tied to our own ideals, privileges, and prejudices in a substantive way. That is not to say that these are sufficient to completely explain the resulting production; it would be unhelpful to attempt a kind of totalising reductionism that cannot critically engage with identities beyond these elements. However, they remain vitally important factors that help to actively define an identity, even as they embroil it within a level of historical subjectivity and political bias. If we use this reasoning and attempt to situate the positions from which Promoting British Values has been written, we can consider both the historical context in which it has been formed, as I have described above, as well as the other contemporary writings that surround it and that form with it a broader gesture of political will. I will now attempt to synthesise a number of these concurrent threads in order to paint a coherent picture of the kind of cultural identity that is being propagated by the government through these texts, and to use Hall’s arguments to question its use as a tool that specifically targets British Muslims. \ 	I wish to begin in this with the primary symbol that constitutes the government’s rhetoric, and that makes up the title of one of the pieces under consideration: ‘British values’. It is a term which is evoked at key points throughout Promoting British Values, The Prevent Strategy, as well as within the wider discourse as it plays out in the papers and mass media. These values are outlined in the Prevent Strategy as follows: ‘democracy, rule of law, equality of opportunity, freedom of speech and the rights of all men and women to live free from persecution of any kind’ (34). David Cameron has himself also attempted to define them in a similar manner within an article written for The Mail on Sunday: \ The values I’m talking about – a belief in freedom, tolerance of others, accepting personal and social responsibility, respecting and upholding the rule of law – are the things we should try to live by every day. To me they’re as British as the Union Flag, as football, as fish and chips. Of course, people will say that these values are vital to other people in other countries. And, of course, they’re right. But what sets Britain apart are the traditions and history that anchors them and allows them to continue to flourish and develop. \ 						(Cameron, “British Values”) \ We can see by placing these two definitions side-by-side that Cameron is attempting to go further than The Prevent Strategy and situate the concept of British values within a wider understanding of British identity, tied as he says to certain traditions and a history. However, rather than providing a truly evocative standard by which we may define what it is that British values and identity are, his comments bear the hallmarks of a political struggle over the nature of Britishness that is described by Chris Allen. Allen says that: \ When answers are sought as to what ‘Britishness’ is, […] the responses are either culturally or civically insignificant: trapped between the culturally banal and trite – fish and chips, queuing, cups of tea, or even more cynically binge drinking, - and the civically indistinguishable – democracy, free speech, equality and human rights – that almost all other modern nations equally aspire to. \ 							(para. 1.22) \ Cameron’s article seems to be located entirely at this juncture of vague definitions, somewhere between what might be thought of as the ‘spirit’ of democratic Western Enlightenment values and the cultural kitsch of the UK tourist board. What he resorts to in an attempt to go beyond this is to say that it is ‘our values and our respect for the history that helped deliver them and the institutions that uphold them [that] forms the bedrock of Britishness’ (Cameron, “British Values”). For Cameron it seems, British identity is rooted just as much in respect for the institutions of ‘parliamentary democracy and free press’, ‘courts and independent judiciary’, and ‘the various churches and faith groups that have come to call Britain home’ than it is in anything else. We find in this narrative the same implied demand for loyalty that we have seen above. \ Whilst it is important to take his comments in the context of what they are—a calculated point-scoring exercise seemingly aimed at appealing to the various anxieties of a certain section of right-leaning voters—rather than a detailed exegesis on the government’s construction of British identity, they remain pertinent when considering the wider implications of the current campaign. For it is the sentiment of Cameron’s article that is echoed within the SMSC Guidance in Promoting British Values: ‘it is expected that pupils should understand that while different people may hold different views about what is ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, all people living in England are subject to its law. The school’s ethos and teaching […] should support the rule of English civil and criminal law and schools should not teach anything that undermines it’ (4). Again, the key aspect Britishness is defined by within schools is an acceptance of and loyalty to the state and its institutions. Whilst the guidance does suggest that, for example, schools should teach the ‘advantages and disadvantages of democracy’ (6, my emphasis) as part of the actions they can take to instil faith in what it determines to be British values, this remains framed within the larger ideological project as an element of ensuring they are delivered to students. The implied conclusion is foregone: the British state’s definition and application of what it deems democracy and justice, within its wider aim of upholding ‘British values’, is correct and equitable. In a cyclical gesture, we see ‘British values’ as being positively defined as adherence to the institutions that publicly define what those values are. \ This might not pose so much of a problem if these actions remained objectively fixed, and unburdened by political whim. However, this is of course not the case. Recent historic trends regarding the post-9/11 War on Terror, and the subsequent effects that this has had upon domestic Muslim communities gives us plenty of examples of questionable behaviour. To take one: the revelations regarding the CIA’s ‘advanced interrogation’ programme, conducted from 2001 until 2006, have suggested evidence that the UK may have been involved to at least some degree in various activities regarding the torture of detainees (Verkaik). Whilst the information regarding the UK has been redacted from the released US Senate report, the on-going requests for information that are being made by various government bodies, coupled with other circumstantial evidence, suggests that at the very least there is cause for concern that Britain may have been complicit with the program (“CIA Report”). Certainly, these actions would seem to run completely counter to what has so far been defined as ‘British values’, particularly concerning the ‘rule of law’ (Cameron), and problematize an earnest and uncritical acceptance of the political rhetoric espoused by the government. \ Further to this, Steven Vertigans has written about the British government’s domestic ‘counter-terrorism’ policies and programmes that he argues are aimed more at ‘recover[ing] confidence in its monopoly of violence’ than in combatting a threat that ‘has arguably, either intentionally or otherwise, been exaggerated’ (Vertigans 32). He goes on to describe the government’s ‘geographical demarcations’ (34) that have been used to target the application of new measures such as ‘enhanced powers of surveillance’ (33), as well as an annually rising number of ‘searches carried out under section 44(1) and (2) of the Terrorism Act 2000’, towards Muslim communities. He also notes that these actions have occurred across a backdrop of increasing public ‘tendency to associate Islamic behaviour and Muslims generally with terrorism’, as well as other racist stereotyping. It is the vulnerability of such programmes to ‘misunderstanding and/or misuse’ (35) on the part of their enactors, coupled with this targeting of minority communities, that Vertigans argues has been causing the ostracization of these communities from mainstream British culture. The resulting splits, anxieties, and tensions that have been caused within these communities has been actively contributing towards the process of radicalisation he argues (35), rather than combatting it as the Prevent Strategy attempts to do. \ Vertigans’ arguments also open up for us a further problem with the government’s policies. Within the Prevent Strategy, it talks euphemistically about ‘communities who do not (or, alternatively, cannot) participate in all civic society [and that] are more likely to be vulnerable to radicalisation by all kinds of terrorist groups’ (Prevent 27) as a result. It criticises previous efforts that have used funds laid out for counter-terrorism operations for projects aimed at promoting social integration and cohesion between minority and majority communities, leading to what it terms ‘securitising integration’ (30) via the unhelpful merging of these two aims. Yet this is precisely what is being advocated within the Promoting British Values guidance for schools. Do we not see here a policy of ‘securitising integration’ that references objectives laid out in The Prevent Strategy as one of its key aims, even as it appears to contradict its explicit methodology? Vertigans argues that ‘there is nothing new in governments adopting practices that are inconsistent with their philosophical and legalist underpinnings’ (36), but despite this I argue we should be extremely concerned with the level of contradiction inherent within these measures designed to directly impact children from minority backgrounds. For the Promoting British Values guidelines attempt to draw an ideological battleground within the British education system, and paints young Muslim students as being dangerously susceptible to terrorist impulses. \ Many of the criticisms along this line levelled at the previous government’s Prevent strategy, published in 2009, by Anthony Richards remain pertinent to the current document, even as it disavows many of the previous methods used and echoes similar criticisms as I have noted in Theresa May’s foreword above. In particular, Richards takes issue with the 2009 report’s use of the word ‘vulnerability’ to radical ideology as a precursor to terrorist acts, in that it assumes that those who commit such acts ‘have succumbed to (violent) extremist ideologies and need guidance so that they can be rescued from manipulation by others (online or otherwise), and that they would not carry out such acts of their own volition’ (150). This he argues makes way for expanding the remit of Prevent to a potentially unlimited size in its targeting of British Muslims, as it utilises vague terminology and an absence of ‘the possibility that terrorism at home could be seen by the perpetrators as a rational act in response to British military action abroad’ (151) in order to imply ‘a diminished capacity for rational behaviour’ on the part of those committing terrorist acts. It constructs the terrorist as a citizen who has been corrupted through exposure to certain ideologies to such a degree that they become liable to commit acts of violence, and that these exist entirely freely from any genuine impetus that might come from the government’s own actions. This is not to say that in fact those committing terrorist acts are justified when they argue, for example, ‘the only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers’ (Adebolajo), as in the case of the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in 2013, but rather that their actions can and should be understood as existing within a broader context that is misguided to ignore. Without this, terrorism becomes defined as a psychological failure on the part of individuals and their communities, and as such responsibility is shifted accordingly. It becomes depoliticised and this movement opens the way for the sort of targeted measures described by Vertigans as a form of community punishment. \ Despite its claims that ‘the Prevent programme we inherited from the last Government was flawed’ (Prevent 1), and that as such the new document will address these problems, the 2011 review still lays out the same aims of ‘prevent[ing] people from being drawn into terrorism and ensur[ing] they are given appropriate advice and support’ (my emphasis). It is this that continues the flaw Richards identifies as a tendency to perpetuate ‘a misunderstanding of the terrorist problem and [deflect] us from a key tenant of terrorism studies—that terrorism involves the perpetuation of rational and calculated acts of violence’ (Richards 151). For Richards, it is this definition of terrorism that clears the way for governments to expand their powers into multiple new areas in the name of defending these vulnerable groups and individuals. He concludes with this: \ The characterization of vulnerability matters because it lends itself to a broader spectrum of response concerned with potentially numerous ‘vulnerable’ individuals, and to the danger that traditionally non-security areas, such as community integration and cohesion, become securitized. And if there is no ‘typical pathway to violent extremism’ then the ‘scope of risk-assessment is rendered potentially unlimited’ for British Muslims.  \ 						(151) \ This leads us back to Hall, and the questions regarding the British government’s use of British cultural identity in their counter-terrorism efforts. Going further into the specificities of the representation of cultural identity, he says that we should consider all identities to be “strategic’ and arbitrary’ (Hall 395), even as we recognise that this is a necessary element to begin to contain their meaning and engage with them. He goes on to make the critical point however that ‘meaning continues to unfold, so to speak, beyond the arbitrary closure which makes it, at any moment, possible. It is always either over- or under-determined, either an excess or a supplement. There is always something ‘left over’’ (396-7). By invoking Derrida, Hall means to draw our attention to the inability for cultural identities to be self-contained and without, as he terms it, ‘play’ (396). On a practical level, it is this excess, this over-determination, that I believe is of primary concern regarding the government’s use of British identity. For, though they mean to use it, at least explicitly, in order to clearly distinguish between what they see as acceptable and non-acceptable beliefs vis-à-vis terrorism and Islamic extremism, the manner in which they have done this clearly establishes a system of binary thought that exclusively targets British Muslims. \ The nature of the discourse is shifted from one of counter-terrorism to one of a division between national and religious loyalty, as well as ascribing community blame for issues of violent extremism. As Paul Thomas and Pete Sanderson have noted, ‘the clear association created by Prevent between ‘Muslim identity’ and the ‘terrorist threat’ underscores the way in which the models of ethnicity and identity underpinning government policy are theoretically impoverished’ (1030). They say that ‘it can be argued that post 9/11, and particularly post the British involvements in Iraq and Afghanistan and the 7/7 London bombings at home, young British Muslims have been under significant media and political pressure to demonstrate loyalty and obedience to Britain’ (1035), something that I think is clearly carried out in the discourses I have been examining. In response to genuine anxieties about the threat of ‘home-grown terrorism’, the government’s response has been to construct a binary ‘us and them’ narrative, in which a dogmatic loyalty to Britain is construed as a valid demand in the face of cultural difference. \ The effect of this is, I argue, to subtly contribute to wider racist and Islamophobic social discourses. I am not saying that it is racist to criticise Islam: free and open critique is and remains the backbone of a democratic and multicultural society. Instead, I argue we should see this fortifying of ‘us and them’ narratives as existing within a wider turn in recent years that has taken hold across the whole of Europe. Thomas Eriksen speaks of this when discussing the recent tragedy of the Anders Breivik shooting: ‘the very ordinariness of the new right wing signals that it cannot be written off as marginal. The view that Islam is incompatible with democracy […] is propagated in election campaigns, online debates, co-ed articles and books on contemporary politics’ (Eriksen 2). It is this element he touches upon, the ‘ordinariness’ of this discourse, which I believe is so troubling. For it is something we see in the UK as well: in November of 2014, London Mayor Boris Johnson wrote an article in The Telegraph in which he capitalised upon Emily Thornberry, a Labour MP, making an ill-advised tweet in which she appeared to mock a white-van-driving, working class English household adorned with English flags. In the article, Johnson remarks on how Thornberry should have viewed the scene: ‘she should see [the flag as] an innocent symbol of patriotism, and love of our country – its language and history and institutions, its Royal family and its countryside, pubs, Shakespeare, football, fish and chips, you name it’ (Johnson).  \ Similarly to Cameron’s article, we find the same lazy signifiers that purport to speak to and for a whole realm of British experience: pubs; football; fish and chips. However, the key element that Johnson emphasises is the ‘innocence’ of this trite celebration of patriotism, and of his simplistic yet acceptable summation of Britishness. Yet, returning to Hall, he says that ‘cultural identities are […] the unstable of identification or suture, which are made, within the discourses of history and culture. Not an essence but a positioning. Hence, there is always a politics of identity, a politics of position, which has no absolute guarantee in an unproblematic, transcendental ‘law of origin’ (Hall 395). There is nothing innocent about these discourses of British cultural identity. If we allow ourselves to believe that there is, then we inevitably fall into scenarios whereby, for example, the Prime Minister can claim freely that ‘this is the country that helped fight fascism, topple communism and abolish slavery’ (Cameron, “British Values”), a statement that marries some small truth with at least one glaring untruth, and that attempts to whitewash an enormous legacy of British colonialism, to say nothing of resultant policy decisions. \ With regards to British schools, this kind of easy slippage furthers a view that Islam is ultimately problematic for Western democracy, that Muslims should be British first and religious second, and that this notion of Britishness is a fixed and clear thing, rather than a constructed identity that serves particular political ends. Under the guise of ‘futher[ing] tolerance and harmony between different cultural traditions’ (Promoting 5), it instead explicitly targets one group as being prone to intolerance and disharmony, and demands that they work to correct this inherent fault. The problems with this is being projected towards children, whose capacity to defend themselves against this level of ideological advance in extremely limited, need hardly be stated.  Further than this, it attempts to establish a largely monolithic conception of British identity, extolling this as a metonymic entity for positive and robust democratic values, when it reality it is a political tool being used to conflate counter-terrorist operations with cultural policing. I don’t disagree that the infliction of extremist ideology upon vulnerable groups is a problem, and that measures should be taken in order to help protect them (Prevent 55-62). However, when the government claims on the one hand that the work of the Prevent Strategy is to remain outside of the realm of community integration, and then on the other continues to conduct this sort of work within minority communities under the Prevent banner, as is the case in Promoting British Values, I argue we are right to remain sceptical. For, as I have argued above, the representation of cultural identity remains political, and we should be wary of those ‘trying to represent a diverse people with a diverse history through a single, hegemonic ‘identity’’ (Hall 401). This is especially true when cultural values becoming marred in concerns of national security. \ In this essay I have explored the government’s problematic use of British cultural identity as a means for conducting counter-terrorist operations domestically, and as an ideological tool within schools. I have attempted to show that this represents a relatively new trend, following the perceived failure of multiculturalism in British politics, but that it also exists within a wider context of Islamophobia both within the UK and Europe, and that the government’s rhetoric plays into racist discourses that depict Muslims as a problem for the West. I have also shown how inherent contradictions in the government’s arguments demonstrate a cynical relativism that allows the redefinition of British identity as it sees fit in order to serve its shifting political desires. I have argued that recent domestic and foreign policies give due cause for remaining sceptical of their actions, and that there is a wide body of academic criticism to support this view. \ Introduction \ Jafar Panahi’s films are that of enclosed spaces. In his 2006 film Offside, a group of girls, attempting to get into the football world cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain by dressing as boys, are captured and detained outside the stadium by a group of young army soldiers. For the majority of the film, they are held within a make-shift pen, and the enclosed space of their confinement is juxtaposed with the surrounding panorama of Tehran; the pen itself being nothing more than a few circled fences. As the film goes on, it becomes clear that the soldiers are themselves victims of a type of confinement, the majority of them wanting nothing to do with their charge, and their leader in particular appearing extremely nostalgic for his home farm, speaking longingly of when he’ll be able to finish his military service and return to it. Later in the film, the soldiers take the girls home in a bus, however they become increasingly surrounded on all sides by growing crowds of celebrating football fans, jubilant at their national team’s victory over Bahrain. In the film’s conclusion, the girls are able to make a break for it in a moment of confusion, and are swept away in the crowd, the soldiers being left totally imprisoned by the sheer numbers of people and unable to pursue or stop them. This final scene is orchestrated by the song Ey Iran, a pre-revolution nationalist anthem of praise and love for one’s country; the previously isolated and trapped characters achieve a kind of escape from the apparatus of the Iranian state via a repatriation with the ordinary people of Iran. \ 	Panahi’s work doesn’t always contain this conclusion of escape and release from confinement however. His collaborative work with Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, 2011’s This Is Not a Film, is a meta-textual piece of semi-documentary set in Panahi’s home while he is under house arrest, awaiting the verdict of his appeal against a 20-year ban from filmmaking and 6-year jail sentence for his continued breaking of Iran’s strict film censor’s demands and codes. He is literally enclosed by the four walls of his apartment, and we the viewers are made privy to his boredom, his frustration, as well as the growing anxiety that his appeal will not be successful and he will be sent to prison – a yet greater enclosure. Like the girls in Offside, Panahi’s imprisonment is contrasted with scenes of him on his balcony, overlooking a wide Tehranian panorama which he cannot enter. Within the film, Panahi also attempts to describe and act out his last unmade film that was rejected by the national censors. He tapes off a section of his floor, and attempts to recreate the story as he envisioned it. We learn it was, ironically, to be a film about a girl locked by her extremely conservative family in her home, after they learn that she has been accepted into a prestigious arts university having passed the entrance exam. \ Panahi attempts unsuccessfully to act out the opening few scenes of his film within the partitioned space he’s made on his floor, as well as describe the camera work and audio track as he envisioned they would be. When he becomes frustrated by his self-perceived inability to accurately convey the full breadth of his vision, he sits down and utters the line: ‘If we could tell a film, then why make a film?’ His frustrations stem from what is apparent: he lives and breathes to make film, and as an artist denied access to his trade he cannot help but attempt to continue with whatever means he has available. The result is that he is left to pottering around his house, although he cannot help himself but record events, no matter how small-scale his work may now be. As his co-star and friend Mirtahmasb says in the film, ‘what do hairdressers do when they are bored? They cut each other’s hair’ (This Is Not a Film). \ These are two examples of the enclosed spaces that are at the heart of Panahi’s work, however there are many others. Crimson Gold follows a delivery-driver and petty criminal as he is slowly driven mad by the confines of class, illness, and his own lack of agency; Closed Curtain, like This Is Not a Film, is semi-documentary and is set within the confines of a house with characters hiding from the law; Taxi Tehran features Panahi as a Tehranian taxi-driver, with the film taking place almost exclusively within his vehicle and captured via a dash-cam, both as a means of eluding the country’s authorities and allowing Panahi to continue film-making, as well as an artistic device to accent and punctuate the narrative. Even in his earliest films, this motif of enclosure abounds: 2000’s The Circle has as its focus ‘women operating outside the law, fugitives in one way or another for whom the male domination of urban space does not augur an exhilarating adventure, or even the illusion of independence, but a virtual prison’ (Arthur 25). In this essay I will explore these examples and Panahi’s use of enclosed spaces, and overall a pervasive sense of claustrophobia, to both imbue his films with a latent political message, and as a means of conveying narrative and helping to draw the audience in to fully understand his characters. The wider effect of this, I will show, is an attempt at formulating for his audience a sense of ‘realism’ regarding the events and circumstances he bases his work upon. I will demonstrate how, via the use of varying and surprising devices, Panahi approaches the kind of artistic realism that he advocates in interviews, and how this represents a union of aesthetic excellence and epistemological weight.  \ In the first part of my essay, I will look at Crimson Gold and how Panahi uses tightly framed shots and point-of-view camera-work, as well as other audio-visual devices, to illustrate non-verbally the state of his protagonist Hussein’s mind and convey to the audience his sense of claustrophobia and frustrations, in such a way that, while not vindicating his crimes and ultimate violent suicide, serve to punctuate the narrative with a strong pathos and elevate the characters above their largely simple everyday actions. I will show how, via the use of the work of philosopher Dominic Lopes on what he calls ‘Photographic Transparency’, we can view Panahi’s realistic, almost documentary-like style in Crimson Gold as carrying within it a wealth of subjective, fictional detail. \ In the second part of my essay, I will expand upon this by looking at how Panahi combines claustrophobia and enclosed spaces with the breaking of the fourth wall and weaving of fiction and documentary together, primarily in the film Closed Curtain. I will show how he goes beyond the representations of claustrophobia that are present in his early work, and begins to examine the philosophical ramifications of artistic ‘over-crowding’, by creating in his film a shared space that cannot physically contain both himself as a person, a filmmaker, and the film itself that he is attempting to make. I will use further work by Dominic Lopes, on the topic of ‘Pictorial Realism’ to make the argument that, rather unintuitively, we may view Panahi’s use of extreme fiction and film conventions as an example of acutely realistic representation that achieves an accurate portrayal of the circumstances upon which it is based. I will show how it is precisely via the use of film as a medium, and a progression of his ideas and techniques developed in previous films such as Crimson Gold and This Is Not a Film, that Panahi accomplishes this. \ In my essay I will carry out close analysis of individual scenes, as well as specific devices Panahi uses within them, in order to draw the conclusions that I reach. I will couple this with both an interpretive framework influenced by Lopes’ essays, as well as my own thoughts and opinions on the topics covered. \ 1: Claustrophobia and Naturalism in Crimson Gold \ Panahi opens Crimson Gold with an extended, single-take sequence from a fixed point within a jeweller’s store. Beginning with the sound of a bird screeching over the opening credits (a bird we later learn is owned by Hussein, the protagonist), the black of the opening title card is revealed to be that of the jeweller’s body, stood with arms outstretched in front of the camera, blocking the light. Hussein is at this point stood behind him, with a gun to his back and demanding the key to the main jewel cabinet. After a brief shouted exchange, Hussein drags the jeweller out of frame to get the key, and we are presented with a view through the front door of the store on to the street outside. Let’s take a moment to examine the composition of this scene. \ 	The door takes up the middle third of the screen and is made of glass, and the remainder is comprised of the interior walls of the store, which are black, and a couple plants symmetrically placed either side of the door. In the street outside, we see another man, Ali, wearing a bike helmet and stood beside a scooter, looking up and down the street anxiously. It’s immediately clear that he is the accomplice of the robber, Hussein, and has been tasked with keeping lookout. The frame itself is immediately claustrophobic. The black of the walls crowds either side of the screen, and the frantic shouting and violence obviously occurring just to the side of the shot is contrasted heavily by the relative lack of action on screen. Without warning, Panahi has plunged his viewers into a dramatic and unnerving situation, but has removed many of the tools that the audience would normally have available to orientate themselves. We are left with a series of questions: where is this taking place? Who are the men we have seen on screen? Why are they committing this robbery and in broad daylight? With whom are our sympathies supposed to lie? And, most basically, what is actually occurring on screen? It is hard to fully engage with any of these questions however, as within seconds there is more shouting, the sounds of smashing glass, and a car pulls up outside with a woman entering the store. Things quickly descend from here: the woman realises what is occurring and runs screaming. In the ensuing confusion the jeweller runs and triggers an alarm, also causing metal bars to fall down over the door of the store. Hussein turns and in anger shoots the man off screen, prompting his accomplice, already terrified that things have gone horribly wrong, to start shaking the bars and screaming at Hussein over what he’s done. A crowd forms outside, eventually chasing Ali off and, after attempting to get the gun that Hussein has dropped near the bars, runs back in fear as he returns. We hear further sounds of glass smashing off-screen as Hussein flies into a rage within the store, and his angry shouts to the crowd outside. Finally, looking exhausted, dejected, and having glanced up at the sky a number of times, Hussein slides down to the floor with his back to the bars, puts the gun to his head, and the scene finally cuts as we hear a gunshot and the screams of the onlookers. \ 	This full, single-take scene, which lasts just under four minutes, has, as I have said, taken place entirely from a single, static camera angle looking out from within the store. Initially, Panahi uses deep focus as a means of providing the audience with an over-abundance of visual information, the effect of which is simultaneous disorientation and inability to fully process events as they occur, as I have described above. However, in the second half of the scene, Panahi begins a very slow dolly in, slowly excluding more of the interior of the store from the frame in favour of the metal bars covering the door and the street outside. While this initially appears to be giving focus to the crowd looking in, it becomes clear once Hussein walks back into frame that in fact this subtle movement has been to draw attention to him, his final moments, and to provide an insight into his mental state. It is, I argue, the first major assistance Panahi gives to his audience, and begins to lay the groundwork for explaining the overwhelming sense of claustrophobia and enclosure that pervades the film as a subjective expression of Hussein’s interior life. When the scene, and Hussein’s life, comes to an abrupt end, the camera is still moving forward and the surrounding scenery around our protagonist has grown smaller and smaller. The final few frames show only Hussein, backlit by the exterior light and so in shadow, leaning back against fully black bars that stand between him and the terrified onlookers who are now out of focus. \ 	Hussein’s world has become impossibly small. Panahi sets up this initial mystery at the beginning of his film, so that in viewing it, Hussein’s ultimate demise hangs over every other scene that takes place. It is in this way, a lingering presence for the viewer, an emotional weight that ceases to leave, contributing to the overall sense of claustrophobia that Panahi builds throughout. It is made even more poignant by the manner in which he makes the film’s first cut. Immediately after Hussein’s suicide, the camera cuts to Ali riding on a motorbike, at what seems to be reckless speed. He is wearing the same clothes as in the previous scene, and Panahi here overlaps the sounds of the store with that of the bike in such a way as to suggest chronological sequencing. Ali’s demeanour also suggests this: he appears anxious, continually looking over his shoulder as he races through the streets and the sound of the shop alarm fades from the soundtrack. There is another cut, and Ali pulls up outside a café, going in to meet – why, none-other than Hussein, alive and well. Just as he seemed to be providing some concrete context to his film’s opening, Panahi pulls the rug from his audience and leaves them again without a clear sense of where they stand in relation to events. \ 	Like F. W. Murnau, director of Nosferatu, Panahi here ‘is interested not so much in time as in the reality of dramatic space’ (Bazin 27, emphasis mine). Andre Bazin’s essay on the early development of the language of cinema, speaks of how Murnau, in his films, utilities apparently naturalistic filming, over other favoured techniques in early cinema such as montage, in order to dramatically suggest elements of his given scene or narrative beyond that of a straight-forward representation of reality as it is. In this way, ‘the composition of his image is in no sense pictorial. It adds nothing to the reality, it does not deform it, [but] it forces it to reveal its structural depth, to bring out the pre-existing relations which become constitutive of the drama’ (27). Panahi here, via the subtle use of a deceptively simple device, suggests a wealth of structural depth to his narrative, entirely via the interplay of his camera-work, soundtrack, and the action as it appears on-screen, within the first few minutes of his film. \ 	Shortly into the café scene that follows the establishing drama, we learn that Ali has come to meet Hussein from obtaining a marriage licence for his friend. In transit between here and there, he has stolen a woman’s purse, and brings it with him to Hussein so that they might look inside and find what valuables it contains. This retroactively imposes upon the previous scene, a sense of explanation for Ali’s erratic driving and obvious anxiety, however it also adds an additional layer of connective narrative depth. Following the café scene, the film proceeds in a straight, chronological fashion, leading up to the events in the jeweller’s store that end with Hussein’s suicide. In this way, the short sequence of Ali riding on his motorbike links the first and last scenes of the chronological narrative, but in such a way as to obscure which of these scenes it is actually connected to. It remains a sequence somewhat adrift, upon which is imposed the sounds of alarms and screams that bleed into it from the jeweller’s scene, the audience’s memory of those events and their connection to it following the standard conventions of chronological cinematic storytelling, and the subversion of those expectations via its lead-in to a scene obviously set prior to the events (narratively) that preceded it (cinematically). \ 	The overall effect of this intensive layering is, I argue, a wider sociological observation about the characters that Panahi is making, beyond that which appears immediately obvious via the narrative. Panahi is here suggesting a strong sense of repetition, of characters being caught within the confines of their circumstances, without any clear opportunity for escape. If we, for a moment, take the sequence with Ali on his bike to occur both before the café scene and after the jeweller’s scene, we see that chronologically the film’s narrative both begins and ends with Ali desperately trying to get away from the consequences of his criminal activity, terrified by what he has done. Panahi doesn’t offer any kind of escape or redemption for his characters: there are no lessons learnt, no saccharin resolutions that show our protagonists rise above their short-comings, however much we may grow to sympathise with them throughout the course of the film. \ This adds an additional layer of claustrophobia and enclosure upon the narrative. Although it takes the length of the film to realise it, the characters remain forever trapped within this cycle I have described above. The potency of the composition of Hussein’s suicide: eyes closed, gun to his head, iron bars behind him and surrounded on all sides by the black borders of the picture frame itself that has moved forward into an uncomfortable close-up, stands to resonate strongly as a symbolic metaphor for the lives of the characters entirely. \ * \ I wish to turn at this point to a later scene in Crimson Gold, in which we see Hussein’s apartment for the first and only time, and how Panahi uses this scene along with many various small details throughout the course of his film to further impose the sense of claustrophobia upon his audience, and how he uses this to make subtle, subversive political observations about Iran’s authoritarian regime and its effect upon society, something that he explores to a far greater extent in his later work which I will examine in turn below. \ In the scene prior to Hussein’s arrival at his apartment, he, his fiancée (Ali’s sister), and Ali himself have visited the jeweller’s store in which the film’s initial scene takes place, in an attempt to buy Ali’s sister some jewellery for the wedding. As has become apparent via an earlier scene, in which Hussein and Ali were barred entry to the store, there is an acute class divide between our protagonists and the store’s owner and general clientele. They have attempted to mitigate this via dressing up: Hussein appears here in a suit and tie, the only time within the film that we see him out of his usual cheap jacket and work clothing. However, this performance doesn’t have the desired effect. After a short time with an assistant, in which Ali’s sister tries on some of the store’s jewellery, the owner comes over to the party, and suggests euphemistically that, as they are clearly from poverty, it would be wiser for them to buy handcrafted gold, made in Iran, which can be ‘rapidly liquidated if ever you’re in need’. Upon asking to see some examples of this, the owner of course apologetically tells them: ‘We don’t have any here. You can find it in the bazaar, in the Galubandak district.’ After some further euphemistic gesturing, he ushers them out of the store with a smile, and leads to Hussein engaging in a sort of silent breakdown due to the stress and humiliation he has received. His eyes roll back, he becomes almost comatose, he refuses to talk to his friends or engage with his fiancée to quell her fears that his rage is due to some slight she performed against him. \ It is on this back of this sequence, that we see Hussein enter his apartment. Panahi utilises very strict camera work here that echoes that utilised elsewhere in Crimson Gold in order to place his audience within the mind of his protagonist; the presentation of his shots is highly reflective of the subjective experience of the character. How is this expressed? Panahi approaches this scene via a single, continuous shot that lasts approximately three minutes. This lends the scene a sense of photorealism that seems to transcend the conventions of traditional cinema, although this appearance is somewhat misleading, as I will explain shortly. At least at the surface level, the use of long take here grants the audience an opportunity to view Hussein truly at his lowest, without interruption or distraction. The scene is very slow, not a lot happens: the action largely consists of Hussein locking his door, walking up some stairs, lifting a shift from covering his birdcage, and trying to sleep before looking out of his window at some small drama occurring outside. We the viewers are able to use this time to observe Hussein, and the incredibly subtle performance given by the actor Hossain Emadeddin. His pace is slow, plodding; he rubs his face a number of times; every movement feels exhausting, every thought a burden. \ The apartment itself is extremely bare, with monochromatic walls and only two pictures for decoration. The lighting is extremely dim: the already dark Hussein is still cast in shadow as he sits on his bed and contemplates his circumstance. We cannot see his eyes as he does this: Panahi’s combination of underexposure and spot lighting mean that although Hussein is in near total darkness, he still manages to cast long shadows over himself and the features of his apartment, suggesting heavily the emotional weight that he is carrying with him. The general lack of sound for the majority of the scene also intensifies the sense of isolation that Hussein is currently experiencing. The only notable audio queue is that of the bird itself, a screeching whistle that is identical to that played over the film’s title card at the very start. This disjointed fragment is suddenly thrown into perspective: it is given no context in the film’s opening, and remains a strange, unsettling sound with no associated visual queue. Here, Panahi bridges the temporal space between the scenes, foreshadowing the events to come but also providing his audience with some insight into the cause of Hussein’s violent crime. The humiliation received at the hand of the jeweller is linked directly to Hussein’s violent treatment of him later during the robbery. Panahi is here triggering an echoic memory in his audience: it’s plausible that for most, the few seconds of the bird screeching will have been registered only unconsciously in the film’s opening, given that they occur whilst still on the title card and are immediately followed by the disorientating and violent action of the opening scene. The sudden, unexpected linking of these scenes gives us a glimpse of Hussein’s desires, his anger, his wish to enact revenge upon the man and lash out at the man who embodies so much of his frustration. \ Panahi’s camera remains, with one notable exception at the end of the scene, entirely within the confines of the apartment. This is something he will take to further extremes later in his film Closed Curtain, which I shall turn to presently. In Crimson Gold’s apartment scene, the camera is locked to a single, narrow focus, and largely follows Hussein in its tracking movements. The result of this is that we never get a full, clear picture of the space he is occupying: the frame remains in medium shot throughout the scene, restricting the audience’s perspective yet again and amplifying the sense of enclosure. Hussein appears all the more alone with his thoughts: his anger is given no immediate outlet for release, it remains as he is, enclosed, trapped, all the time building in pressure. \ The payoff to this moment occurs outside the window of the apartment. Hussein is lying on his bed attempting to sleep, the camera slowly panning in on him, when suddenly the silence is broken by a series of heavy bangs, and a man’s voice calling out ‘I didn’t do anything!’. Women’s voices quickly join in, and as Hussein stirs the camera follows his focus of interest towards the window. We see outside soldiers aggressively bundling a family out of the apartments opposite, ignoring their protests and marching them out on to the street and away. The camera has here exited out of Hussein’s window, and it slowly peers down towards the street below, mirroring what we assume to be Hussein’s own movements as he presumably cranes out to determine what is going on below. As the family are moved out of sight, the camera rotates round slowly to look back in upon the window it just exited. We see Hussein, standing at the window, enclosed on four sides by its frame. Panahi here echoes a framing motif that occurs at numerous times during his film: Hussein enclosed within a frame. It is used in multiple scenes when he is riding on his motorbike: the front glass windshield has in it a black-bordered frame which Panahi often aligns with Hussein’s face, enclosing him. It occurs in three separate scenes in which Hussein comes to the entrance of a building, and is kept outside by the occupant: he is bordered on the one side by a door and doorkeeper, closed so as to obscure what is occurring inside from both Hussein and the audience watching, and on the other by the frame of the camera itself as Panahi remains in medium close-up, heightening the restriction of movement. Even as we the audience are allowed to leave the confines of Hussein’s apartment and view him from the outside-in, we see that he is denied such liberty, that once again he remains trapped. \ As we have seen, Panahi here uses a number of techniques to hint at his character’s inner world and suggest both visually and audibly the overwhelming sense of claustrophobia experienced by Hussein, and the violent desires that he is incubating. Panahi has, by and large, approached the scene in a formally naturalistic fashion, one that utilises both a real-time sequence of chronological events, without cuts, and a soundtrack that is comprised of what appears to be entirely sounds caused within and around the space being filmed. However, as I have argued above, Panahi also imbues this scene with a series of deeply symbolic and suggestive gestures, which run parallel to the sequence of events as they occur on-screen. In order to reconcile these two seemingly disparate threads, and better understand how it is that this seemingly unrelated cause and effect are in fact linked, I turn to Dominic Lopes and his ideas regarding what he calls ‘photographic transparency’ (“Photographic Transparency” 432). \ In his essay, Lopes is responding to those he refers to as ‘sceptics about photography as an art form’ (432) and their claim that ‘when we look at photographs we literally see the objects they are of’, which in turn logically means that, as opposed to media such as painting or music which both necessarily and clearly require a degree of artistic representation in their creation, ‘there is no photographic aesthetic’. The argument runs that photography, and by extension film itself as nothing more than a series of photographs run in sequence with accompanying sound, is not truly an art-form as it is merely the direct recording of whatever objects or scene is placed in front of the camera lens. Thus, any aesthetic appreciation of what is depicted is merely an appreciation of the object in and of itself, rather than the photograph of the object. He names Roger Scruton in particular as being a leading proponent of this viewpoint, and sums his arguments as to why we might falsely believe that we’re appreciating a photograph, rather than object it depicts, as thus: \ That some photographs of representations generate the illusion that they are representations may explain why we erroneously believe that photographs are representations. But no photograph can derive fictional competence or the power to misrepresent from having a representation as its object; it remains a photograph of actors and props. Representations shown by means of photographs are not photographic representations. (435) \ This is, as he terms it, Scruton’s ‘equivalence thesis’ (435), that photographs are equivalent to the object they depict, so that any ‘interest [that] involves the exercise of aesthetic concepts, the concepts apply to features of the object photographed, not to features of the photograph itself’. \ 	It is not too hard to see how we might take this position regarding the aesthetic creativity shown in Crimson Gold, that despite some of the arguments I have made above, we are merely impressed by the direct viewing of the actors and staging, in such a way that would be, although difficulty, technically possible to achieve live on a stage to more or less the same effect. Or, failing this, that we could imagine ourselves as spectators in events as they are occurring, something that is often in many ways encouraged by Panahi’s camera work. We could imagine ourselves as observers being led in some way by Panahi, to have our direct observations mimic the camera work he has laid out, and thus experience a nearly identical effect if we were placed in the flesh in place of the camera. In the very least, we can see how one might argue that what is depicted on screen is simply the sum of direct recording, not of artistic rendering. However, there are a number of quite obvious flaws with this position, ones that do not align with the criticisms I have made of Panahi’s work and seem to lead to quite the opposite conclusion: that in fact his films display an extremely high level of ‘fictional competence’, even as they mimic an apparently direct recording of events or at the very least a feasible approximation. It is for this reason that I turn to Lopes’ arguments themselves in order to better interpret the apparent wealth of narrative and imaginative detail Panahi achieves within his naturalistic filmmaking. \ 	Lopes argues that, while a photographed object does in fact record a given object (that is, barring extensive post-process manipulation, it is the result of a causal process of recording light on to a photographic film or image sensor), it is photography’s status as a ‘transparent’ medium that allows us to both see the object depicted, and the object as viewed through the photograph simultaneously, and thus draw artistic merit and conclusions from the deviation between these two frames of reference, as well as any inherent value we find elsewhere within. It is this which he calls the ‘value of seeing through’ (441), via which ‘a photographic aesthetics grounded in transparency is viable if seeing something through a photograph may arouse an interest not satisfied by seeing the same object face-to-face opens up’ (442). He goes on to list a series of five factors that set photography as an art-form apart from others: ‘photographs capture their objects fixed at a moment in time’ (442); ‘photographic seeing through bridges distances, either spatial or temporal’ (443); photography ‘isolates the photographed object from the context it would normally be seen to inhabit’; ‘the camera sometimes intrudes upon or disturbs what it photographs’; and ‘finally, seeing photographs is typically twofold in the sense that it melds seeing the photographed object and its properties with seeing the photograph itself and its properties’. \ 	This list seems to correlate quite directly to what I have discussed in Crimson Gold until this point. Despite operating under the guise of fairly straight, naturalistic film-making, Panahi’s efforts remain thoroughly other than a direct representation of events in any way that occludes deeper symbolism or a complex journey into subjective experience, via the way in which he utilises a transparent medium. When speaking of another, stylistically similar film of his, Offside, Panahi comments that ‘the film is constructed like a documentary in which I have inserted fictional characters. Are we in a documentary, or is this fiction? I wanted the action to reflect this ambiguity’ (Maruf). It is, I argue, precisely this ambiguity itself that generates the full depth of artistic insight into the characters Panahi portrays, as well as the situations he places them within. \ 	Via his use of non-actors and realistic settings, Panahi establishes the conditions for seeing through that grants the high level of fictional competence apparent in his work. Take, for example, the character Hussein himself. As has been discussed in other interviews and promotional material surrounding Crimson Gold, Hossain Emadeddin is both ‘a real-life pizza-delivery man, and a paranoid schizophrenic’ (Brooks), who was at times incredibly ‘difficult to work with’, and would on multiple occasions ‘smash up the set, get on his bike and just go home’. Such an approach to filmmaking can lead to a strong sense of realism and an unpredictably brilliant set of performances, as Panahi notes when viewing back footage of Hussein’s breakdown outside the jeweller’s store midway through the film. He comments: \ With an amateur actor like Hossain, the details won’t be predictable in advance at all. You write some things, but when you go on location and the amateur enters, he does the directing on you. He leads you to how you explain the film. […] How could I explain before making the film: Hussein should lean against the wall, do the thing that he did with his eyes, and that I had never seen before? I mean when I told him to act, he did all the by himself. I don’t know. (This Is Not a Film) \ And yet, despite all this, we see in his work the ambiguity layered on top of the action, in the same way that the photographic frame of the film camera is layered on top of the visual information of the scene that we watch. It is the interplay of the seemingly-real and the obviously not-real, the documentary-like approach to his filmmaking and the clear apparatus of filmmaking itself, which generates the tension, drama, and artistic genius within Crimson Gold. \ 		 \ 	 \ 2. Realism in This Is Not a Film and Closed Curtain \ Expanding upon these ideas of realism, and how they are linked to the high artistic merit and social commentary of Panahi’s films, I wish to now turn my attention to his later work, and how he explicitly plays with the notion in Closed Curtain. Specifically, I wish to look at this in light of further writings by Dominic Lopes, and his work on pictorial realism. \ 	In his essay titled on the subject, Lopes examines what he sees as the various ways in which the perceived ‘realism’ of an artistic piece corresponds to its capacity for ‘informativeness’, that is, its capacity to convey information about a depicted subject, in an attempt to draw up some kind of concrete schema via which we may more accurately assess to what extent these elements are linked, and how we might go about applying them. In his piece, he is responding to previous thinkers such as Nelson Goodman, who have in his eyes, failed to provide an adequately robust theory of realism. In fact, he goes as far as to note that Goodman’s attempts to align historic standards of realism with European ethnocentrism, itself ‘reinforces ethnocentric conceptions of realism and undermines understanding realism across cultures’ (“Pictorial Realism” 285, note 3). So instead Lopes aims to build upon those aspects of Goodman’s work that he believes are valuable: his ‘insight that realism is relative to system’ (277) but also connect it ‘in a new way, to informativeness’. \ 	His overall line of reasoning, inasmuch as it can be summarised in the given space, is that ultimately, ‘a picture is realistic to the extent that it belongs to an appropriately informative system’ (283). By ‘informative system’, Lopes is here referring to the surrounding interpretative framework that interprets it, comprised of factors such as its historical and cultural context, its relationship with other, similar works, its capacity for, as he terms it, ‘revelatory shifts’ (280) in understanding of representation, akin to the European adoption of perspective in Renaissance art, etc. In this way, he pre-empts the argument that realism is simply a ‘matter of standardness’ (281), i.e. that it is tied exclusively to the standard form of other works within its given context and has no room for forming a new model of realism of its own along novel or unique modes of thought. Instead, realism becomes a measure of ‘quantity of systematic informativeness’ (282): a window through which we might gauge the success of a work’s attempt at realism by how much it informs us about the interpretative framework and general context into which it fits. The process in this way becomes a two-sided affair, one that also requires a knowledge and interpretation of the general system into which a given work falls. He finishes by concluding that ‘a picture is realistic to the extent that it belongs to an appropriately informative system’ (283), thus allowing for works that currently appear to us, a given audience, as unrealistic the possibility in the future to be made realistic via the development of suitable informative systems around them. \ 	The consequences of these conclusions are a rather robust definition, that ‘explains the diversity of what is considered realistic in difference contexts of use’ (283), allowing that ‘a system which seems more realistic in one context of use may be inadequate in another’, but also that sometimes ‘revelatory realism’ may occur: ‘an unfamiliar system of depiction may make commitments which are unexpected, drawing our attention to hitherto unseen features of the world and its contents.’ This leads to the allowance of seemingly strange and totally ‘unrealistic’ artworks that, via their informative system, are actually rendered extremely realistic: \ How can cartoons belong to an “appropriately informative” system of representation? […] Although they represent their subjects as having a limited range of properties, cartoons convey information which plays a key role in the narratives within which they occur. […] I would venture that the realism of, for example Gary Trudeau’s caricature of a former president of the United States as empty space derives from the appropriateness of lack of characterization in the context of satirizing lack of character. The point here is not that the presence of a narrative context explains realism, but that that the narrative context makes a small number of represented properties salient. (283-4) \ This capacity for a seemingly unrealistic element, device, or format to render a thoroughly realistic representation given the correct interpretive system, is why I have continued to use Lopes when considering Jafar Panahi’s later work. \ 	In This Is Not a Film, realism and authenticity are primary concerns to Panahi, despite the clear Dadaist joke regarding authenticity in the film’s title. The central gag of his circumstance—that he faces a 20 year ban on filmmaking, but what actually constitutes filmmaking as such?—is a spot of black humour used to both defer the consolidation of what the impending sentence will actually entail, and to open up and explore the nature of filmmaking, artistic expression, and realistic, authentic representation. He speaks at numerous times during the film that ‘I feel what we are doing here is […] a lie. […] The rest will certainly turn out to be lies no matter how it proceeds’ (This), and this anxiety over realistic representation, even in the case of Panahi and Mirtahmasb filming each other, as Mirtahmasb puts it, ‘behind the scenes of Iranian filmmakers not making films’, belies a deeply rooted concern that applies to his artistic output more generally. There is a concern to represent events as they are for Panahi, and it is for this reason he is concerned over his efforts in the early part of This to create a distinctly film-like experience in which he purports to show himself undisturbed by the camera, in the style of ‘fly on the wall’ documentary. As Rob White puts it:  \ This Is Not a Film makes room for the fictional, even the mythopoeic, in low-tech cinema vérité. The pet iguana that creeps around the high-rise dwelling […] is a prisoner’s dear companion but also a creature from fairytale, a nonchalant domestic dragon. Imperceptibly portals open to another sphere, an incandescent magic world […] in the exhilarating final moments of This Is Not a Film, Jafar momentarily escapes his internal exile […] and in the magnificent concluding image we see that, beyond the elaborate gates, the capital’s streets are on fire. (White 6) \ Much like Crimson Gold then, This exhibits elements of transcendentalism even as it operates under the guise of naturalism. The suggestion is that via the use of a somewhat false authenticity, the pretence of direct communication with the audience, we might arrive indirectly, as if by accident, upon a more genuine and ‘realistic’ sense of truth than is normally possible via the tools available to conventional narrative cinema. \ In This, he asks the question: ‘If we could tell a film, then why make a film?’ The first half of the film consists of a process of failure via which Panahi comes to this realisation, or rather, the attempt to persist in a process of failure despite already knowing this truth. This is a film that contains within it another un-named, un-made film. Rejected by Iran’s censors, despite changes to the script Panahi made in an attempt to appease them, this un-made film about a girl locked within her house by her strongly conservative family is only evoked via descriptions and Panahi’s attempted dramatizations. We the audience receive nothing but the trace of this film, its potentiality and possibility as Panahi’s actions and words throughout This try to get in our minds what this film may have been. It is not only Panahi as an actor within This that drives this project either: the very form of This, its context as a documentary of Panahi’s real house arrest, as a philosophical treatise on the nature of censorship and of artistic talent repressed, all contribute to a sense of what this un-made film might have been. This proposes to offer an insight into the mind of Panahi as director, as an artist, and so via this glimpse suggest what perhaps that un-made film could have been. \ 	All of these factors contribute to why, among many other things, his later film Closed Curtain provides such an interesting and fruitful companion piece to This Is Not a Film. In one way, Curtain serves as a counter-point to the imaginative journey that This takes its audience on: beginning as what appears to be a conventional fiction film, Curtain’s narrative begins to come apart near the film’s midpoint with the introduction as Panahi on-screen as the character of himself within the film. Initially a mute presence, drifting through the house in which the film is set on the back of a particularly tumultuous scene, the character of Panahi quickly becomes the film’s major focus, and the characters previously who’d previously been members of the fictional narrative become meta-textual observers, a kind of Greek chorus of Panahi’s mind who struggle to share the same physical space as these people from a version of the ‘real’ world; that is, one meant to be taken as the same which the audience inhabits. \ 	I’ll briefly summarise the plot of the film and this particular narrative turn, in order to better orientate my criticism. The film begins with a man entering the house with a dog he’s been carrying in a bag. He quickly sets about blocking out all the windows with black sheets of cloth, and within a short period it becomes apparent that there is some sort of religiously driven mass dog cull occurring within Iran, and that the man is hiding so that his dog won’t be killed. He is also a writer, though we never see his work or learn exactly what he is writing (there are hints however that it may be the script for the ‘film’ in which he is currently starting, adding an extra level of meta-reflection to those which come later). One evening, after emptying his dog’s litter tray outside, the man returns to find a brother and sister have entered the house. They claim to be on the run from the law, something that causes the writer enormous distress, which is heightened by a tense scene shortly after in which police begin banging on the door, seemingly searching for the brother and sister. Shortly after this, the brother leaves looking for help, and asks the writer to watch over his sister for a short period, who he claims is suicidal. What follows is a number of scenes in which the two get to know each other a little, however there is always a tension as the writer simply wishes to be left alone to work, and not risk the authorities finding him and his dog. After an argument between the two on the house’s roof, the sister, Melika, asks the writer ‘why am I even talking to you?’ and retreats back inside. Following her however, the writer finds that she has seemingly vanished. After a brief search, he gives up and assumes his previous daily activities, presumably quite content to have this complication removed from his life. \ 	A number of scenes later, having left the house to take the dog for a night-time walk, the writer returns to find the girl has magically reappeared and is waiting for him on the house’s stairwell. She begins going about the house pulling down all of the black curtains blocking off the windows, revealing that it’s actually day-time (another seemingly magic transformation), and, going upstairs, she pulls down further black sheets from the house’s walls uncovering a number of large film posters for Jafar Panahi’s earlier films. As the two go out of shot, the sounds of sheets being pulled down and the writer shouting for her to stop on-going, Jafar Panahi as character walks on to screen for the first time, seemingly observing the two and looking thoughtfully at the scene as it has unfurled. From this point on the film’s narrative becomes increasingly unclear. Some sort of burglary occurs, during which the camera remains with the writer, who hides away with his dog in a wall panel he’d constructed earlier in the film. Panahi as character re-emerges, only he arrives as if for the first time, in the day immediately following the break-in. The writer and Melika begin disappearing and reappearing periodically, as well as providing an audio-commentary of Panahi as character, sharing the home with him but never appearing to occupy the same corporeal space. Panahi as character invites his neighbours over, fixes the window broken during the break-in, and in a depressive state seemingly contemplates suicide, before finally leaving the house at the film’s conclusion. There are a few scenes in which he appears to watch footage of earlier scenes in Closed Curtain, as they were being filmed, with Pahahi the director in them. He also has a number of imaginative sequences involving Melika, who increasingly seems to be some sort of embodiment of the suicidal urges shared both by Panahi as character and the writer. Near the end of the film, a woman claiming to be Melika’s sister comes for her, to whom Panahi reacts in total confusion as, it seems, she doesn’t exist in the same world as him, despite sharing the houses space from our perspective as the audience. \ 	To say the least, then, the plot weaves a number of complicated relationships and events to provide a dense, multi-layered piece with a number of possible interpretations. Instead of an evocation of a fictional film within a documentary, as in This, Panahi has here reversed the relationship and evoked documentary within a narrative, fictional film. Panahi as character appears to be much the same as we have seen him before, still unable to create the film that he imagines, and the action that comprises the first half of Curtain becomes reduced to some figment of his imagination, to that of only potential film, rather than actual. As we see during the second half of the film, Panahi as character sits and watches a short video made apparently on his phone, in which the fictional girl of the first half walks into the sea, drowning herself. This is explained immediately afterwards via a voice-over between her and the writer, in which she asks ‘Is he [Panahi] dead?’, to which the writer replies: ‘No… you’re the one who’s dead for him’, ‘He killed you off’. Thus, Panahi sets up for his audience an interpretive framework via which to understand certain sequences that appear impossible: characters appearing and disappearing, apparent suicides, invisible observers, all of which are given as examples of the imagination of Panahi as character, enacted for the audience on-screen. These fantastical elements, including the film’s opening fictional narrative, are presented as existing in relationship with Panahi as character and as a general reflection of his mind, desires, and ideas. \ This relationship is complicated by the overlapping within Curtain of ‘fictional’ and ‘real’ worlds, via the device of the home burglary that marks the mid-point of the narrative and the event which interrupts the conventional fiction of the plot. There are elements within the latter half of the film, such as comments made by the character Panahi’s neighbours of activity within the house prior to his arrival, that serve to disrupt any reading of events as a strict distinction between fiction and reality. And, of course, this entire relationship occurs within the film Closed Curtain; as spectator, there is no clean outside of this context within which it is possible to establish any sort of truly neat division between art and artist. Even before we begin to talk about wider contexts for this relationship, it is quite clear that describing these two elements within the film as binary opposites is at best a simplification and at worst an arbitrary reduction. I will return to these elements later and attempt to paint a more rounded and encompassing picture of what Panahi achieves within his work, but for the time being I will treat this distinction as somewhat clearer than it is so that I may explore more deeply the status of Panahi’s narrative film within Curtain, and how it may be thought of in light of This. \ 	With this simplification in mind, let us look at the spacings within Curtain and This; specifically how Panahi navigates the spacing between Panahi as character, the figure of an artist, and the manifestation of his work. It’s telling that in both films, Panahi has himself as character occupying the same physical space as his work, his un-made films, and that in both instances this sharing of space is uncomfortable and extremely claustrophobic. In both films, the space itself repeatedly demonstrates that it cannot be shared; that rather than co-operation between an artist and his work, there is in fact an implicit tug of war occurring between the two parties and at any one time the relationship is one of dominant and inferior subjects as opposed to one of equals. \ In This, aside from the practical frustrations that Panahi experiences while attempting to share the space of his home with that of the work he is trying to evoke for the audience, there is a clear moment in the film in which the impossibility of that shared space becomes apparent. At the sound of fireworks being set off in the city outside of his apartment, Panahi is shaken out of the trace-like energy he’d previously experienced in describing his ideas. He quickly begins removing all traces of his act of telling his film, for fear of being discovered and making worse his prison sentence that clearly troubles him at the start of the film. Whether he mistakes the fireworks for gunfire, or is simply startled by the unexpected interruption isn’t clear. However, it serves to highlight a tumultuous undercurrent that remains largely unarticulated by Panahi or by Mirtahmasb in their dialogue, other than a few explicit references at the beginning of the recording. The prison sentence, which initially seems to be something of a formality, almost a joke between them, is shown to carry a level of emotional depth for Panahi that belies his somewhat light-hearted treatment of it. There is real fear here; there are consequences for engaging with his creations. Panahi discusses this in an interview, when he once confronted the censors: ‘I asked them if I wasn’t showing the realities in my films, and if I was lying or exaggerating. They admitted I was showing the realities. So I asked, if they think I show the existing realities in my films, why don’t they allow them to be shown? They told me not every reality should be shown. I think the realities are much darker than what you see in our [Iranian filmmaker’s] films.’ (“Excerpts from a 2008 Interview”). \ In Curtain Panahi’s on-screen relationship with the reality of his work is far more ambiguous, given that he plays with it in a conscious fashion as he enters the film as himself and provides a counter-narrative of apparent documentary against the fiction of the film’s first half. In this act of play, it often seems that Panahi is presenting the audience a dilemma: that Panahi as a real person cannot truly exist alongside his work, that in fact co-existence between the two is impossible. At the very least, Panahi seems to suggest that this cohabitation is extremely destructive, even potentially fatal for one or both parties. \ The relationship of Panahi as character to those other characters that occupy his home with him is worthy of some discussion. The peculiar ambiguity that Panahi maintains throughout Curtain is, I argue, an intentional device used to preclude any strictly linear reading of this relationship; I would even go as far as to suggest that it ensures that there can be no singular interpretation of events that stands as the authoritative ‘real’. The way in which Panahi plays with gaze is particularly striking in this relationship, and its manifestation via the use of two cinematic devices: the visibility/invisibility of certain characters at given intervals, and the use of cameras within the film as a means of communication between characters, specifically the sequences in which the writer and Melika appear to film themselves on Panahi’s iPhone, which he later watches back. I’ll look at each of these, before turning to how they are related, below. \ 	In her essay on Jacques Derrida’s discussions of cinematic love, and blindness, Akira Lippit talks of how for Derrida, the relationship between characters in love, as they appear on screen, is transformed in complicated ways via the medium’s use of images, and how these constitute a loaded gaze of observers, and subjective internalisation of these images, as opposed to a simple exchange of emotions. The invisible is not simply an effect of characters being unable to see something hidden: it is, for Derrida, in fact a fundamental component of relationships. She explains: \ The visibility that Derrida imagines secretes its own medium and a mode of spectatorship, blindness, intrinsic to it. Blindness, says Derrida, is an effect of the invisibility of the visible as such. Absolute invisibility inhabits and haunts the visible, lives in and lives on or after the visible as blindness. Visibility secretes invisibility, “as if it were secreting its own medium,” producing blindness. […] The invisibility that Derrida sees is not an aspect of visibility, neither a phenomenon nor an essence of the visible: it is an image that inhabits or haunts the visible right on the visible. (Lippit 86) \ This idea of the invisible inhabiting and haunting the visible seems to describe almost exactly the way in which Panahi composes the relationship of Panahi as character, to that of his film’s characters, on-screen. The co-habitation, as I have noted above, is a particularly uneasy one, and one which contains in it a nagging sense of compulsion, rather than free choice. \ 	This is well demonstrated late in the film, when Panahi as character has entered the house and enlisted the help of a neighbour’s friends to fix his window. As he makes tea for them and engages in small talk downstairs, above, Melika and writer have re-appeared, and an exchange occurs between the three parties. Melika comes half-way down the stairs, and sits watching for a few moments, looking anxiously at Panahi, who remains oblivious to her. She then heads slowly upstairs, and, upon seeing the writer who it seems has only just re-appeared, smiles and heads over to him with purpose. He is busy writing, acknowledges her, and then returns to his work. After a moment, she takes the papers from him and throws them into the air, exclaiming ‘Why are you still writing? It’s all over!’, and ‘He saw me. When I looked up, he was staring at me, totally mesmerised. Now that he’s seen me, I’m back in his thoughts. He’ll let the melancholy of dusk take him away’. She is, of course, lying, a fact that the writer notes as he points out that Panahi would surely not be getting his window fixed if he intended to kill himself. However, she insists: ‘Why keep on writing? Who’ll make it into a movie? Take your dog and leave.’ \ 	The ontological status of Melika and the writer is drawn into question via these sequences. They seem to exist in a super-state: at once they are characters in a drama we the audience have been watching; they are observers of the film we have been watching until this point and commenters on it; they are figments of another character’s imagination, characters for a yet un-made film he is planning or merely wishes to make; in the case of Melika, she is also seemingly a metaphorical figure or spirit, meant to embody the feelings of depression and suicide felt by both Panahi as character, and the writer. They exist in these modes both within and without Panahi as character: we are told at numerous times that Melika has access to his thoughts, and she exclaims at one poignant moment to the writer: ‘you write it and he [Panahi] shoots it. Then what? You think you can capture reality, especially in here?’ Even as they observe him, they appear very much to be a part of him; in this way, the three characters are refracted aspects of one another. \ 	This peculiar sequence of relationships and musings on the difficulty of shared space seem to be a strange way to approach the topic of cinematic realism, and in particular the wider issue of representation that Panahi attempts in both This and Closed Curtain whereby the negative effects of state censorship upon artists is laid bare. However, as I began to show earlier with Dominic Lopes’ work, it is via an interpretation of the film in the context of how informative it is in a given system of representation that should determine for us the given success of any attempt at ‘realism’ within art. And thus, if we view Closed Curtain’s twisting narrative, fractured genre, and strained relationships as evoking through implication the reality of a given situation, I think we can see clearly how Panahi achieves a high degree of realism in his work that belies its seemingly high level of artifice and fiction. When Lopes says that ‘seeing an object through a photograph is not identical to seeing it face-to-face’ (“Transparency” 441), it is vital that we also consider that ‘photographic seeing through may foster and satisfy aesthetic interests that face-to-face seeing cannot foster or satisfy’ (446). \ 	The anxiety therefore displayed by Panahi at the start of This Is Not a Film, that his attempts to convey the reality of his situation are ‘like pretending in a sense’ (This), appears in the last analysis to be misplaced, and this is something we see that Panahi has worked through by the time he reaches Closed Curtain. For, given that Panahi’s chosen medium of expression is film, he cannot but present to his audience a high level of ‘pretending’, of performance. We cannot do any other but view his work via ‘seeing through’ the photographic frame presented to us. There is no way via which he might reach his audience in a direct, naturalistic sense given the medium he has chosen. Therefore it only makes sense that he goes so far in the opposite direction: of providing truth and realism via the extreme rejection of what we might expect this to look like within traditional filmmaking conventions. By opening up his reality to us in this way, he offers the audience a chance to interpret and also engage with him on this level, and thus achieve the realistic representation he seeks in This Is Not a Film. \ Conclusion \ In my essay, I have attempted to demonstrate how Jafar Panahi sets about achieving narrative realism and artistic poignancy in his work, in an attempt to make comments about life under a repressive authoritarian state, via the use of various cinematic devices that evolve from his early to later work. In Crimson Gold, I have shown how Panahi uses multiple tools to evoke a strong sense of claustrophobia within his work, and how this leads us to a better understanding of his protagonist Hussein’s mental state. Given that he is working within the genre of narrative cinema, Panahi utilises many subtle elements at his disposal to provide a complete meta-narrative that runs alongside the seemingly naturalistic filmmaking that he undertakes, and it is via the use of Dominic Lopes’ concept of ‘Photographic Transparency’ that we may better understand the full effect of Panahi’s work in this way. In his later film, Closed Curtain, I have attempted to understand why it is that, in attempting to achieve a level of realism in his work, Panahi adopts a seemingly extreme position of high unrealism that on first viewing disrupts the audience’s attempt at understanding his work as being representative of a genuine state of affairs. It is once again via the use of Dominic Lopes’ work on ‘Pictorial Realism’ that I have shown how, with the correct interpretative framework, we can see Panahi’s use of extreme artifice and disjointed, genre-defying narrative as examples of realistic representation. This doesn’t have strong bearing on the aesthetic worth of the film itself; rather it is a means of demonstrating how Panahi’s own attempts to, in his own words, ‘show the realities [on which he bases his films] without distorting them, judging them, or even offering any solutions to the viewers. I try to show the realities as I see them’ (“Excerpts from a 2008 Interview”). \ I have in my essay been guilty of treating Panahi’s works as ends unto themselves: as a singular body of work largely devoid of further contexts outside those of Panahi’s immediate vicinity and the restrictions of liberty placed on his personal and professional life. In doing so, I have of course obscured further avenues of pursuit that will likely yield very interesting and perhaps radically different conclusions to those that I have drawn, and viewing these texts within a context of works reproduced, repurposed for consumption by liberal Western viewers instead of an audience similar to the lower-class Iranian characters Panahi often depicts is one such direction I think would likely be an interesting one to take. I have, however, I hope, illuminated some small aspects of Panahi’s work that are themselves more than worthy of critical consideration, and in doing so provided some appropriate means via which they will be better appreciated. \ In examining the spaces utilised by Jafar Panahi in his film Offside, I feel it is useful to first make a number of assertions that will form the basis of my argument, and that, I hope, I justify fully over the course of this essay. Firstly, I believe that in order to fully appreciate the interplay between oppression and resistance within the film, it is useful to view it primarily as a discourse between Iran’s revolutionary government, with its hard-line religious ideology, and the general Iranian public for whom Panahi claims to make his films. Moreover, I believe that it is through analysing this ideology itself, and how it precisely marks the events on-screen that the mechanics of his subversive message will be understood. Whether he intended it or not, I believe that within his film, the effects of this ideology operate upon two ‘levels’ of space: first and foremost, on the physical locations chosen by Panahi and the meanings that can be read into their selection; and secondly, though no less crucially, on the ‘inner’ space of the characters, specifically in how this ideology attempts to govern their thoughts and behaviours, and the effects of its success and failure. Ziba Mir-Hosseini’s has argued that, when it comes to Iranian cinema, ‘the art of ambiguity (iham), perfected in the work of classical poets such as Hafez […] cannot be sustained in the performative  and graphic arts, where both the language and the form demand greater transparency and directness in the depiction of women’; I argue that it is precisely through the sustained ambiguities in his film that Panahi most effectively articulates resistance to the restrictive spaces imposed upon the Iranian people. \ 	The main action of the film takes places within a small, fenced pen constructed outside of one of the entrances to the Azadi football stadium in Tehran. As a location, the make-shift pen is symbolically indicative of the real-world manifestations of the authoritarian state ideology with which the film engages. It is reflective of this ideology both in its practical application, that of imposing a real restriction on the movements of the girls, and in the very form that this ideology takes. As a prison, the pen is both simultaneously there and not-there at once: its status as a prison is only temporary, the rails of its walls having presumably been taken from some other use, its open top and lack of significant boundaries afford a wide view of the sky and the city of Tehran below, suggesting that they do not exist at all. Yet it is nevertheless real and physically tangible in its effect of enforcing a restriction on the girls: though they haven’t actually been arrested, they are not free to leave. \ The translation of doctrine into physical temporality thus is spontaneous, indeterminate, and opaque; even the soldiers themselves aren’t sure of how long they will be stuck at their post before being relieved. The ability for this prison to exist without boundaries that are clearly marked by signs or walls means that it exists in a state of spatial limbo: the idea of imprisonment is what solidifies its boundaries, meaning that, potentially, it can appear in any space should this idea be enforced, something that Panahi plays with later in his film. The prison space thus exists everywhere and nowhere, without ever being clearly identifiable as existing here, in a single delineated position. \ Though they are the enforcers of this idea of imprisonment, the soldiers are not the source from which its power derives. The obvious unease with which the lead guard, the ‘Azari Soldier’, carries his command is explained by this: he is simply a conduit for the ‘Chief’, this bogey-man type character whose arrival is, for the larger part of the film, always about to occur but never quite does; he is forestalled in physical form but is very much present as an imagined observer of the scene. This is why the Azari Soldier’s profound anxiety prevents the girls from watching the game through the bars. He tells them: ‘Why don’t you get it? I’ve got responsibilities. The chief will be here any minute. He’ll see you, freak out, and punish me.’ Any illusions about higher moral motives at this point are dispelled by his admission: the threat of punishment, of violence, is what prevents the girls from seeing the match. \ 	At this stage, I’d like to consider the theories of Louis Althusser regarding the role of ideology within what he termed the ‘State apparatuses’. In his seminal essay on the topic, Althusser draws a distinction between what might be called ‘concrete individuals on the one hand and concrete subjects on the other’ (162); a subject being a person, with all of their thoughts, feelings, subjective viewpoint that constitutes the world for them, whilst an individual, simply put, are the stuff of statistics, an idea of ‘people’ generally, that doesn’t encompass all of these multitude of factors. In reality, he argues, of course ‘an individual is always-already a subject’ (164), there is no such thing as an individual who is not also simultaneously a subject, however, as a hypothetical, it is useful to imagine that the two can be separated in order to tease out the workings of this abstract ideology on more mundane occurances. \ The Azari soldier, I argue, is to be considered a ‘subject’ within the confines of the imaginary narrative of the film: he plays a leading role within the story, he expands and develops over the course of the film, he is likable and is lent a significant pathos in the way he humorously portrays a simple country boy who would much rather be back in his village ‘on the farm with my cattle’ than caught up in a city football game and arguments of gender politics. The Chief, on the other hand, exists only as an ‘individual’, as the figurehead for an abstract and distant authority, with no dimension to his character beyond this, an whose role within the rigid confines of the film is simply Panahi’s device for conveying Iran’s ‘(repressive) State apparatus’ (136). This can be seen further both in his title and appearance. Lacking a definite rank beyond ‘chief’—he is simply a superior—and the fact that his uniform is an ambiguous business-casual shirt and jacket combo, the Chief conveniently combines any and all offices of the (repressive) State apparatus: ‘the Government, the Administration, the Army, the Police, the Courts, the Prisons, etc.’; the Chief’s undefined role potentially spans all of these and his power, like all of these, is solidified in that he ‘functions by violence’. \ 	Now, viewing the Soldier as a subject, who is effectively as much a prisoner of the Chief’s whim as the girls are, and who is imposed upon by these State apparatuses ((SA), in Althusser’s abbreviation) even as he is a part of them and enacts their commands upon others, we begin to expose the power structures with which Panahi is grappling in his film. For, in his unique position as both an enactor and enactee of these structures, he is I feel the best example of a ‘concrete subject’ (160) within the film, of a real substantive person upon and through whom ideology can be seen to take form. That ‘the category of the subject is only constitutive of all ideology insofar as all ideology has the function (which defines it) of ‘constituting’ concrete individuals as subjects’ (160) means that, for Althusser, ideology can only take physical form through people. Also operating upon the subejct are what Althusser calls the ‘Ideological State Apparatuses (ISAs)’ (136). To briefly summarise these, the ISAs consist of those organisations and systems in society that operate primarily outside of the violent remit of the SAs, identified by Althusser as encompassing the ‘religious’, ‘educational’, ‘family’, ‘legal’, ‘political’, ‘trade-union’, ‘communications’, and ‘cultural’ spheres. The ultimate function of these he argues, when all diversities and apparent contradictions are boiled down to a single, driving purpose, is to impose upon the state the ‘ideology of the ‘ruling class’’ (139). In the case of Offside, this ideology is the grounds by which a repressive gender politics is exercised, and so, in watching the Azari Soldier attempt to reconcile the monolithic system of ideology, imposed upon him from outside, with his own, lived experience, we can better understand the full ramifications of these implicit systems and how they might explain a more subtle, more wide-reaching space of restriction, imposed from inside one’s own body, that affects the characters beyond the confines of the thrown-together pen. \ 	The movement from the open, airy locale of the interior of the stadium for the toilet scene is how Panahi choses to demonstrate the clash of the ideological gender politics with everyday life in the wild as it were, as opposed to the largely theoretical discussions held by the characters up to this point. In doing so, he is utilising different threads that operate on multiple levels, coming together seamlessly to fully convey to the viewer his message.  \ 	First, at the level of plot, the choice of a public toilet for this clash of ideas is extremely telling. As a location, it is unique in that it is simultaneously an extremely public and an extremely private space. As Ruth Barcan details in her essay on the social politics behind restroom etiquette: ‘public toilets are not only ambiguous spaces and contested spaces, all the more so they are also multiple spaces, in the sense that they house many needs and practices.’ The complex social rules governing public toilet use seem to exist with a heightened attention to detail; the social stigma attached to ‘getting it wrong’, to look where one isn’t supposed to, to make a sound or smell that offends others, generally causes one to be very aware of both one’s own body and the bodies of others. In this way they are spaces of forced encounter; Barcan goes on to describe embarrassing anecdotes of being forced into unwanted intimacy with work colleagues by the necessity of sharing bathroom space and how, even when they are empty, the various objects within the public toilet are marked by signs of previous bodies, and in this way they ‘serve as proxies for the unknown others who use the space’. \ Already a site of social difficulty, the public toilet also contains multiple barriers that attempt to partition space into separate, self-contained cells, but these walls, being only thin, do not totally prevent the passage between them of ‘sound, which, like smell, “is no respecter of space”’. The effect of these semi-porous separations is to make one hyper-aware of any thing that does manage to pass through, and the gut-reaction is to treat it with disgust and indignation that it should do so. Thus, when the Mashhadi soldier is left alone for a moment in the toilet, and half-hears suspicious sounds and words being muttered from behind a cubicle door, he begins quietly but viciously searching for their source, certain that he is going to uncover some horrific sexual act occurring in secret. The audience, too, joins him in this assumption, and so the surprise and embarrassment felt by him as he bursts in on a wheelchair-bound old man being helped by his young grandson is shared by them, which in turn helps to highlight the absurdity of his attempts to keep this ‘dirty’ space pure through humour. \ The soldier’s vigilant attempts at sanitising the space enough to allow the ‘Girl soccer player’ to use it, masking her face with the ridiculous poster, demanding that all the other men leave and remain outside, telling her to even cover her eyes so as to not read the writing on the wall, these actions clearly mark him out as one not adhering to the ordinary social structures that dominate acceptable bathroom behaviour. As such, the irony is that whilst he is trying his utmost to cohere with the state ideology that he is charged to enact, the fact that he has been forced into a situation that isn’t ‘covered’ by this reveals just how limited its perceived relevance to ordinary social life is. The other football fans wanting to use the toilet are generally undeterred by the presence of the girl, with one of them even making sure that she is able to escape while they hold the soldier back. This act mirrors the offer made to the ‘First girl’ at the start of the film by a boy to ‘help’ her to get into the stadium, and reveals that the men comprising the crowd are generally far more open and accommodating of the women among them than the hard-line religious policy would have one believe. \ In order to really demonstrate just how alienated this outlook is from common beliefs, Panahi utilises the form of his shots to maximise the soldiers separation, transforming him from a guard(ian) into a prisoner himself. The camera work reflects the closing-down of the soldier’s personal space as even the very surroundings begin to turn against him. In the initial confrontation after the girl has entered the toilet, Panahi utilises a standard shot reverse shot sequence, placing the audience first in the point of view of the soldier and then the football fans attempting to gain entry, an exchange that traverses the symbolic boundary established by his presence. This free passage remains for the duration of the conflict, as his authority remains (albeit precariously) in place, and he himself is free to dictate who may enter and who may leave. As he explores further into the depths of the bathroom, the camera mirroring his movement and creeping behind him in a long shot. At this stage, he is unsure of what the cubicle may contain, and the camera is likewise unable to freely explore the spaces beyond his knowledge. It has to wait for him to uncover what is contained within, cubicle by cubicle, before it is able to move into a better position and see for itself. As the second confrontation breaks out, and the soldier, already having been shown unable to distinguish between ‘legitimate’ and ‘illegitimate’ behaviour, becomes trapped, the camera remains with him in an over shoulder shot, imprisoned as he is by the wall of fans. \ In the final shot of the scene, in which he realises that he has lost the girl amid the chaos of the crowd, the camera follows him up the stairs and ramp to the stand, before pulling in for a close-up of his face with the pitch and vast size of the stadium visible behind. In a moment that seems reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo, in which James Stewart’s character Scottie, crippled by his fear, is unable to prevent Kim Novak’s, Madeline, from (apparently) falling to her death, the soldier, having had his masculine authority subverted, is left helpless, unable to protect his girl as he thought he was. Even the horns and drums blaring out of the crowd at this point seem to gain a moment of unity and mock him in a bizarre parody of the climax in the memorable Bernard Herrmann score. This absurd melodrama, following as it does from the already farcical antics from the toilet, demonstrates at once both the comedy and tragedy of the soldier’s situation: he is, ultimately, simply a young man, attempting to ‘protect’ these girls from a perceived danger as dictated to him by his superiors.  It is this ‘bitter humour’ however that Panahi utilises in order to draw attention to the fact that his actions, however well intended, are contributing to a situation in which ‘women have to deny their femininity to take part’. \ 	I wish to turn finally to the last location of the film: the bus used to transport the girls on to the Vice Squad. The bus itself, a mobile prison cell, begins as a sobering reminder of the reality of the girls’ incarceration, the solid, impermanent walls providing a far more restrictive counterpoint to the flimsy, open-topped fences of their first cell. However, as the scene progresses and the Iranian football team grow closer to victory, the soldier/girl divide—which had been quickly re-asserted by the arrival of the Chief, just as it seemed to be breaking down in light of the Iranian football team’s goal—again begins to erode as it is clear that both soldiers have warmed to the girls, despite the Azari soldier’s exacerbated cry of ‘when will I get rid of them?’. Despite confirming the solidity of the barrier created by the bus, not letting the ‘Young girl’ leave when they pull up outside her house, the first sign of permeability is shown in the restriction when the soldiers leave the bus momentarily, and bring the girls drinks from a road-side café. \ Following the final whistle of the game, the celebrations that begin inside the bus seem to solidify once and for all that the soldiers’ position as guards has melted away in the light of shared joy. Panahi does something very interesting with the space at this point. As the bus drives on, the various vehicles visible through the windows, beeping their horns and with people hanging out of windows and waving flags, begin to amass around the transport and slowly box it in. The very object designed to imprison the girls becomes, like the soldier in the toilets, itself a prisoner of the surrounding crowd, and finally it has to stop completely as the jam becomes total. The boundary between the inside and outside of the vehicle is quickly fractured, as first a man from the crowd enters the bus, and then the soldiers are pulled out and swept up in the celebrations. The film then ends on an ambiguous note. Quickly reacting to the removal of their guards, the girls frantically leave the bus themselves, seemingly to make a mad rush for freedom. However, rather than attempting a quick escape, the girls light sparklers and make their way slowly through the crowd, cheering and singing with them, joining the celebrations. While we presume they do get away, we are not shown this explicitly. The introduction of the song ‘Ey Iran’ at the end, the pre-revolution Iranian national anthem, breaks with the ‘semi-documentary’, ‘Iranian neo-realism’ style that the film has maintained until this point, as it seems even the film itself is swept up by the joyous fervour and forgets its own narrative conventions in light of the victory. \ In this closing scene, Panahi clearly celebrates the ability for nationalism to unify people and remove the barriers between them. Given the obvious restrictions that are placed upon the girls throughout the film in the name of national ideology, the acknowledgement of this ‘other side’ to nationalism may be understood in light of his claim that the ‘people in Iran want to return to their national identity’; that is, the identity found in such places as the new year festival ‘nowruz’, those that are grounded in the people’s cultural inheritance rather than the revolution government’s impositions. When Hamid Dabashi talks about Iranian film as a ‘perfectly modern response to the predicament of our [Iran’s] place at the colonial end of the twin projects of the Enlightenment and Capitalist Modernity’, he too highlights the obverse side to nationalist endeavour. As a country with a recent legacy of colonial subjugation, the expression of these sorts of spirits are not simply resisting hard-line religious doctrine, but they also resist this Western definition of Iran as ‘the civilizational Other of the project of the Enlightenment’. Given the well-known and very harsh restrictions that have been placed on Panahi as a result of his film-making, his artistic vision is clearly one that dares to imagine a way of resisting this legacy outside of that pursued by the revolutionary government. Whether or not the idealised ending of his film is simply a fantasy, the huge risks he took in getting it on screen, and the punishment he’s faced as a result, certainly suggest that there may be more to his ideas than wishful-thinking. \ My primary interest in this essay is the voice within the text, its presence, absence, presence through absence, its ability to drown out the experience of others, to rewrite them, to rewrite itself; its multifaceted fluidity that makes it hard to pin down with any degree of certainty and reveal its total nature. There seem to be few metaphors as perfect for describing what it is that she is doing in her novel than that of Jacques Derrida’s différance: his playful neologism on the nature of textual meaning and how it is generated both through the difference of elements from one another and the deference of readings to come. The structure of Assia Djebar’s re-examination of history, both personal and national, is based in exactly this concept. As a reader and a writer of these histories, a ‘temporary story-teller’ as she puts it, ‘try[ing] my hand’ at weaving them into a concrete novel, Djebar sets up seemingly opposing narratives to play off one another, across the gaps of centuries and stifling social decorum, colonial displacement of the subject ‘I’ in favour of an all-encompassing alterity, and pulls from the resulting cacophony unexpected threads that connect as with ‘a flash of lightning’ (81), bridging the space between their interaction. \ It seems fitting, given how one of her aims is to ‘set free’ (145) ‘all the voices of the past’ that have remained until now ‘imprisoned’ by the narratives of control that comprise much of her source material, to examine her work alongside a text of Derrida’s: ‘Scribble (writing-power)’, in which he considers the relationship of writing and power(s), specifically through a look at Bishop William Wurburton’s The Divine Legation of Moses Demonstrated on ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, but in such a way as to throw light on a universal aspect of how they interact. His reading marks the Egyptian priest, who used the hieroglyph as a means to ‘hide their knowledge from the common man’ (56), as a figure allegorically standing in as ‘this very special social agent [who] represents that place and function in which scientific, religious, political, technical, and economic powers are capitalized in the power of a lever of writing that overturns natural relations’; in whom writing imbued power of control over these various forces. Within Fantasia, this agent takes the form of the French soldiers and writers whose words on the war imposed upon the experiences of the occupied Algerians that Djebar attempts to locate. For Derrida, it is the ‘veiling’ (JD, 55) (a fortunate word that he uses throughout his essay, corresponding to its use in the French translation from which he is working, and whose full implications I will explore later) effect of the writing on those it depicts that demonstrates the power that is manifested in its production, and its ability to silence of the self-same. To determine how Djebar breaks (and uses) these silences, I will be exploring them as the ‘remanences’ (JD, 69) of this power. \ To begin then as Derrida does: ‘Who can write? What can writing do?’ (JD, 50), and, to add a further question: ‘How [can] a woman speak aloud’ (AD, 156)? Specifically, I want to begin by looking at one woman, the narrator, and how she writes, how she speaks aloud, how her writing of speech speaks through the text. We are first introduced to her on the cusp of her loss of innocence, ‘a little Arab girl going to school for the first time’, a journey charged with the knowledge of hindsight that upon its completion ‘misfortune will inevitably befall [those]’ who allowed her to undertake it: ‘the foolhardy father, the irresponsible brother’ (3). From the start of the text, writing is imbued with a danger, something that ensures she will ‘write that fatal letter’, and from this it is clear that ‘writing does not come to power. It is there beforehand, it partakes of and is made of it’ (JD, 50). In this instance the power lies in its double-ability to both break and maintain the silence imposed upon the narrator by her father. The ability to write means that ‘her voice, albeit silenced, will circulate’ (AD, 3); the ‘father’s condemnation’ (4), though aroused once, is able to be subverted without his knowledge, she is able to speak without speaking. \ This process of writing leaves a mark though. The act is invested with the verboten, the ‘amorous snares’ (180) of its letters that Djebar describes cling to the writer and threaten to force her exposure: a ‘public unveiling in front of sniggering onlookers’ (181); for she is writing in the language of Algeria’s coloniser. Thus, her father’s ‘silent fury’ (4) at her having received a letter from a boy is a knowing reflection of his own impotence. He recognises in the innocent letter that his authority can no longer protect (or subdue) his daughter, that it is ‘setting the stage for [her] rape’: not of her body, but of her very identity. For the language she is writing in is, as Latin was for the Algerian writer Augustine, centuries before her, ‘a language imposed by rape as much as by love’ (216, my emphasis added). H. Aldai Murdoch writes that through this the ‘duality which the subject must undergo stems directly from the insistence of patriarchal coercion and a falsely constituted desire for alterity through the use of the language of the colonizing Other’, but I argue it goes beyond this. The desire is not simply ‘the product of the imposition of patriarchal law’, this is merely a spurring point, ‘encourag[ing] the intrigue’ (AD, 4) of the narrator. Instead, we should draw the origin of this desire back to that of the coloniser: France. The ‘cryptic expression of some sudden, desperate passion’ (4) that the narrator interprets is there within the very language being used in the letter, whether the boy writing it realised this or not. \ This is something we may see illustrated by the juxtaposition of this prologue with the initial invasion of Algeria recounted in the chapter that follows it. The experience of Amable Matterer as he sails towards Algiers, how ‘he gazes at the city which returns his gaze’ (7), demonstrates a reciprocal relationship of desire that pre-dates anything done by the narrator’s father. It is in this silence, whose presence permeates the text, that of both being gazed at and gazing upon, that we may unravel some of ‘the main issues to which the text addresses itself’, for there is nothing ‘falsely constituted’ about it. This silence is charged; within this figurative space lies the unrealized, perhaps the as yet unrealized, offspring of desire and of fear. Talking later in the novel about a religious programme that she listened to in her childhood winters on the radio, ‘The Ballad of Abraham’, the narrator gives us an aside about her father that seems to embody this empty fantasy space: ‘Abraham could have been my father who never expressed his own feelings aloud, but who, it seemed to me, might have…’ (171). The same silent non-expression that contained the father’s fury could have, it seems, contained his tenderness and affection as well. It is a space of pure potentiality, where all unrealised possibilities are simultaneously true and untrue. The silence of the observer Amable as he stands under the ‘thousands of watchful eyes’ (7) of the ‘silent spectators’ within Algiers contains both the horror that the war will bring, and the beauty that will emerge as a result, of which the novel itself can be assumed to be a part. \ This brings us to the multitude of silent (silenced) women within the text, whom Djebar envisions primarily through the various ‘Voice’ chapters, though who can also be found elsewhere. These women, sisters and wives of maquisards, forever suffering imprisonment and torture, having their homes and possessions burnt and destroyed, how does Djebar allow them to ‘speak aloud’? There are numerous instances throughout in which we are reminded how very real the power of speech can be for these women, how a few words from them or others can mean life or death: the hostage woman who, upon being made to give up her jewellery to Aïssa ben Djinn before being released, calls him and his men ‘brigands!’ and ‘highway robbers!’ (98), before the others protest: ‘Hold your tongue, wretch! Do you want to get us all assassinated?’; the girl who, after joining a group of partisans with her brother Ahmed, being ambushed by the French, and witnessing her brother’s death, hides in the forest undergrowth from the soldiers: ‘I suddenly had an urge to cough. I was afraid they’d catch me. I picked some oak leaves (they are said to be good for a cough) and chewed them silently’ (120). For these women, silence is an absolute necessity; even a small noise would condemn them to death. \ These extreme situations provide an interesting counter-point to another scenario in which these women feature within the novel: that of the ‘family gatherings of former times’ (153), and a more general but still highly regulated everyday life in which everything is conducted ‘according to an accepted protocol’. For in these situations, it seems the women are, for the most part, engaged in what might be termed a ‘noisy silence’, in which they may talk, but never really say anything. The question posed by the narrator, ‘why don’t they ever speak?’, is surrounded by women ‘exchang[ing] inaudible greetings’ with one another, going through the motions of conversation, but one that is so tired and rehearsed that in reality they ‘exchange little more than mime’ (154). In these every attempt is made at maintaining the silence as completely as possible. Even when finally engaging in candid speech with one another, in which confessions of domestic abuse and ruin are given so as to go some way to providing relief to each woman of her ‘deep inner hurt’, an endless series of strategies are employed to distract as fully as possible from the fact that the silence is finally being broken ‘by means of understatement, proverbs, even riddles or traditional fables’ (155), through which ‘the women dramatize their fate, or exorcize it, but never expose it directly’. One gets the feeling from such desperate attempts that this exposure in its own way could spell a fate analogous with death. \ However, Djebar does not allow these women to remain languishing in a silence that is passive and defeated. Rather than a stilling of the voice, these silences are a kind of potent dormancy, a waiting for the right moment with which to let loose the voice, one that is collective and that encompasses all of their experiences, that engages with all of the ‘four languages’ (180) that the narrator says all women have at their command ‘to express desire’. Thus, when the girl hiding from soldiers finally returns to her brother Ahmed’s body, is finally able to grieve, the voice with which she cries is not merely her own: \ One prolonged, preliminary cry has escaped her […] the voice soars, gaining in strength, what voice? That of the mother who bore the soldier’s torture with never a whimper? That of the little cooped-up sisters, too young to understand, but bearing the message of wild-eyed anguish? The voice of the old women of the douar who face the horror of the approaching death-knell […] the voice of the child whose hands are red with henna and a brother’s blood? \ Rita Faulkner reads Djebar’s exploration of the collectivism in Algerian women’s experience psychoanalytically, with Djebar in the role of analyst, and her work as ‘the tracing of the traumatic piercing or wounding—patriarchal writing on the body via physical and/or epistemic violence’. In her essay, she sees the continuous, almost barrage-like stream of voices that assail the reader throughout Fantasia as a symptom of an ‘obsessive-compulsive repetition’, either latent within Algerian culture ‘or its men’, and that this symptom emerges as a result of the repression of the societal woman. Thus, the interchange between silences and the cries that populate the text is one of deeply rooted psychological hurt, of a traumatic struggle that is taking place within the turbulent psychic forces of the body-psyche, the imagined collective body of Algerian women. Given the unceasing violence that occurs to them throughout the novel, this seems a fair analysis. \ The idea also, that Djebar utilises the Voices in such a way as to enter a dialogue, one between analyst and patient, to attempt to ‘work through’ some of this trauma towards the beginnings of a recovery, is well supported textually. In a passage in the chapter ‘Embraces’, the narrator almost seems to be seeking penance for her (re)telling of their stories, of narrativizing their pain: she lays before them ‘offerings’ (142), but all she can give are ‘handfuls of husks, culled from my memory’. It is clearly not an easy thing that she does, and we can certainly feel some of the guilt that colours her efforts when she confesses to the ghosts of these women that ‘I have captured your voice; disguised it with my French without clothing it. I barely brush the shadow of your footsteps’, and this is despite the fact that without her, these voices might have had no outlet at all. However, this in itself is balanced against a penultimate musing in this passage, that it is not her that is writing but ‘Bosquet or Saint-Arnaud’, French soliders, ‘using [her] hand’. She admits that she ‘condone[s]’ this, and it is here that a final tension within the text lies: that despite her empowerment of these women, her actions remain reliant on, and to some extent a direct result of, those of the perpetrators of the women’s suffering. This is a tension recognised in Murdoch’s essay: \ in situating herself as a writer who must come to terms with the history of Algeria and with herself as a postcolonial, Arab, female subject writing in French about Arab women who do not speak French and cannot speak for themselves, Djebar’s narrative will inevitably problematize its own discourse to the point where its own tenuous coherence threatens to dissolve. \ 	The solution to this tension lies, I think, back in Derrida. In examining the powers that structure the writing of the text, the ‘shroud[ing]’ (AD, 142) attribute that Djebar’s use of the French language has on the experiences of the Algerian women should be seen in terms of a simple question: for whose benefit is this shrouding occurring? The violence of it, which might, I suggest, be ascribed closely to Derrida’s ‘veil’, is not to be underestimated. But, rather than being a violence that exists solely as a result of active French colonial powers, it is something inherent to language, a feature to be found universally. The words written initially to convey news of the war to France, words that veiled the experience of Algerian women, have been reclaimed by Djebar in her text, she has ‘unveiled, disencrypted, made public, the mechanism of power’ (JD, 66), explored the silent unwritten words and found that ‘between the lines these letters speak of Algeria as a woman whom it is impossible to tame’ (AD, 57). \ 	So, two conclusions may be drawn from this. The first regards the state of this ‘veil’ of language after Djebar’s efforts, how it is that it continues to function and to what extent one may see it as continuing to impede on the ghosts she confronts. Derrida talks of the ‘production of surplus value’ (67) inherent within language that necessitates the production of a new veil to replace any that has been deconstructed as it were and laid bare. So, it is important to acknowledge that despite all, this effect of language does to some extent still remain, and the narrator’s confessions and offerings seem to do just this. Regardless of what Djebar does, there simply are some silences that cannot be coaxed into speech, and those that are remain, to some extent, ‘a blemished truth’ (AD, 181) as a result of their conversion into French (and, not to forget, later into the English of the translation from which I have been working). Something is still erased and some things are still forgotten. However, there is an aspect of this that I have until this point ignored, and this forms the basis of my second conclusion. \ 	The production of the veil is a process the occurs with the purpose of privileging and empowering those who wield the ability of interpretation, and it is in this way, I argue, that Djebar manages to subvert the colonial powers that imposed themselves upon Algeria’s women, and goes some way towards returning to them this power of agency. For it is in the freedom of representation, the ability to decide ‘between two contrary meanings of the same mark or between two distinct marks with the same meaning’ (JD, 63), that power resides: ‘knowing how (or in order) ‘to represent things’—this is the first action, the first action language as well, dictated by need, by that which begins by lacking […] power, the power that the priest commandeers, results from the necessity of ‘representing something else’; and it appears at the threshold of representation’ (67). Before Djebar’s working through of the histories written of the invasion and occupation, that power remained commandeered by the ‘priests’ of this language, the French; following these labours, representation is returned to the Algerian women. \ 	It is in this light that we may approach Faulkner’s treatment of the text’s silences from a standpoint of ‘wildly political and literary feminist psychoanalysis’. In seeing them as spaces of resistance, both to analysis, and where ‘resistance also comes to mean opposition to political and patriarchal oppression’, we may see how Djebar’s re-writing of these spaces, re-interpreting their meaning, subverts the traditional power dynamic that initially defined them. Like the writer Bosquet, whom Djebar accuses of attempting to define his acts ‘a posteriori’ (AD, 56) in a Caesar-like fashion, her own writing allows the reclamation of previously erased memories, and it is through this that ‘the program with which Djebar aligns herself is one of rewriting—curing—the female body-psyche subjected to patriarchy’. \ Analysing the opening lines of this document, there are immediate tensions regarding its content and the style of the writing, and how these attempt to lead the reader toward a particular conclusion about the outcome of Queen Elizabeth the First’s progress. Presented as a historical account of the events, a ‘Memorandum’ (line 19, p. 428), the account is aimed at recording the events as being both flawless and enjoyable for both the members of the city and the Queen herself. \ 	The first sign of this is when Elizabeth is described as staying at a farm in order to ‘Attier her [sef] self in that respecte of of her wyllyng good mynde to shewe her self coumfortable to the Cytesyns & to a grett number of people of all countreys abowt ther assembled’ (lines 26-30, p. 428). Firstly, the author is ensuring the reader believes that the queen is comfortable before her citizens and that this is also clear to anyone who looked at her by her appearance. The implication is that not only does she look the part before her subjects, but also that this is a natural post for her to hold, one that she has no trouble in assuming. Secondly, the author’s reference to the ‘grett number of people’ (lines 29-30), and later on listing the high numbers of those gathered to see her in lines 1-4 of page 429, assets the importance of this occasion and the high amount of loyalty to the queen felt within the city. That it is also mentioned that they are wearing ‘skarlett gownes faced with black satten’, ‘grayne gownes’, ‘violett in grayne gowns’ and otherwise their ‘best apparell’ (lines 2-6, p. 429), especially as the weather is ‘fowle & rayny’ (line 1, p. 431), shows the expense that the citizens are willing to pay in order to show their support. The detailed account of the colours and materials used presents for the reader an exciting and vibrant scene in which everyone in attendance is visibly pleasing to look at. That the rain is only mentioned at the end of this section suggests that it is not a factor in this part of the progress, and is only recorded as a formality. The colours of the clothing are shown to be the dominant visual aspect of the scene, not the rain. \ 	The author repeats the positive attitude of the people involved with the progress multiple times, enforcing the idea that everybody involved is very happy with the proceedings. The queen is mentioned as having a ‘cheerfull countenance’ (line 16, p. 429) multiple times, and later the boys giving speeches are noting as ‘vtteryng verry very good & dilectable matter’, to which everybody present ‘did geue verry attentyve [y]eare’ (lines 20-22, p. 430). Given that at this point in the proceedings there had already been a number of speeches and other displays to the queen, and the rain, it seems likely that this is an embellishment of events. With the large number of people involved in the event and the inevitable noise this would have caused, it can be inferred that only those closest to the boys would have heard the exact content of their speeches, and that the others were simply waiting for the continuation of events. The author’s presentation of events as perfect in this sense suggests that the speeches were made and received favourably as planned, and so it is important to imply that everything else fell in line with this pattern so as to improve the appearance of the city as a whole during the event. \ 	The author also uses an interesting description of the queen’s countenance in that he says that it is ‘pryncelie’, and that this was ‘specially noted & well liked of as her’ by ‘the nobles & honourable & others’ (lines 27-29, p. 429). Given that Elizabeth was famously a queen without a king, this detail serves to establish that the city is supportive of her despite this fact, indeed suggesting that any male influence upon the throne is completely unnecessary. An official record demonstrating that she exhibited a ‘pryncelie countenance’ (lines 28-29, p. 429) and that many people witnessed this fact would serve as evidence against any who held doubts as to whether she was capable of ruling on the throne. Given that this visit occurred only a few years after she was declared an illegitimate queen by the pope, this aspect of the record implies that these doubts were a reality and that it was important to encourage support for her rule. This fact also explains the other instances highlighted in which the author is apparently trying to present the queen as a strong monarch, and ensure that the official historical record also presents her as such. \ Jean Baudrillard’s exploration of the emergence of what he calls the ‘simulation simulacra’ in contemporary science fiction generates a number of interesting questions when its ideas are examine alongside Philip K. Dick’s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. One specific field to which his ideas can be applied is that of post-colonialism within the text, or to give it a more contextually aware term: ‘techno-orientalism’. In this instance, techno-orientalism refers to the prevalence of colonialist ideas and attitudes in literature dealing with an imagined future, and how these are used within and without the text by those who are aware of the implications of these attitudes, in this case, Dick. The major thing that sets it apart from ‘classic’ Orientalism is its focus on the maintaining of a Western-centric dominant identity, rather than establishing one outright in an emerging industrial world. Through the examination of this theme in Androids, Baudrillard’s work proves to be very illuminating for the text as a whole, as well as for possible motivations that might have been driving Dick at the time of writing. \ 	The most notable figure of the techno-orient in Androids is that of Roy Baty, the primary antagonist and leader of the renegade androids Rick Deckard is dispatched to retire. Described as a large man with ‘intelligent eyes but flat, Mongolian features which gave him a brutal look’, Baty is the epitome of Edward Said’s ‘contrasting image’: the terrifying ‘Other’, both for the Rick Deckard and the Caucasian androids in Baty’s company. Despite the many ambiguities in the text regarding empathy, emotions, and whether these feelings are truly real or not, Deckard is shown to be ‘capable of feeling empathy for at least certain, specific androids’ (109), and even Pris and Irmgard at least appear to show emotions such as ‘rapture’ (117) and ‘compassion’ (121) towards each other and J. R. Isodore. Baty on the other hand is not only a ‘rough, cold android’ (139), but seems to revel in his ability for cruelty, being the one to push the torture of a spider furthest with his book of matches (159), as well as being the only android to vote to ‘kill Mr Isodore and hide some-where else’ (125-126) with no provocation. More than this though, Baty possesses certain metaphysical attributes that define him as more than simply a particularly brutal android, namely the ‘repellent quality’ (140) that Deckard interprets as hanging about him from the notes he reads written by Dave Holden. \ This repulsion appears to be tied up in Baty’s ‘mystical preoccupations’ (139), a phrase that is evocative of Said’s own observations of the ‘imaginative demonology of “the mysterious Orient”’ found in 1960s and 1970s American television, film, and media. He is likewise exoticised by the character of Rachel Rosen, whilst at the same time belittled and derided: she calls him both ‘deranged’ (142) and ‘a wonderful, spiritual man’ (149) in the space of a few pages. This double standard is both purposeful and typical for the figure of the techno-orient. It is a necessary part of the Western construction of this identity, part of what Betsy Huang calls the ‘techno-orientalist tropes [that] are clear expressions of the West’s envy of and contempt for the East’. Baty’s past actions are therefore open to the Western figures of the text to any and all interpretations that they desire. As a Nexus-6 android, he is literally a tool to be used however his master wishes, the logical conclusion of the Western construction of Eastern people as ‘instruments for national and global (i.e., Western) progress – a construction that renders them at once containable, exploitable, and inhuman’. Dick has personified this imposed Western identity within his text, and his characters’ reactions to Baty are indicative of the subtle facets of this construction at work. \ 	Baudrillard’s theories of the three orders of simulacra go some way to place Baty, a signifier of old prejudice, within the context of a story that is set in a future or alternate world. His claim in the essay ‘Simulacra and Science Fiction’ that the imagination in modern science fiction is only capable of an ‘implosion’ of ideas, rather than the previously seen ‘explosion’ (B) of ideas that focused outward from ourselves towards the stars, gives some explanation for the strange figure of Roy Baty. As a system of classification, or more accurately, active reclassification, Orientalism is a force that both interprets and obscures the reality of life in the East. It is however, fundamentally, a series of lies, used to transform the East into a distorted mirror that ‘define[s] Europe (or the West) as its contrasting image, idea, personality, experience’; a chillingly accurate example of Baudrillard’s models of simulation: ‘a hallucination of the real, of the lived, […] presented with transparent precision, but totally lacking substance’ (B). This system of oppressive reconstruction may accurately by classified as one of Baudrillard’s models, in that colonial domination pre-empts the reality of the oppressed and remoulds it as it sees fit, creating a hyperreality. It is not based on a truth that has been expanded upon or exaggerated; instead it is itself the origin upon which reality becomes based. The racist ideas it instils in the powers of the West are made manifest through their privileged position that allows them to shape the world in their own image, and thus shape the East into their anti-image; a grand upwardly scaling example of the ‘domination’ that Said identifies as taking place when the writer Gustave Flaubert takes control of an Egyptian courtesan through his writing, which allows him ‘not only to possess [her] physically but to speak for her and tell his readers in what way she was “typically Oriental”.’ Within Androids, the existence of these themes and ideas demonstrates Baudrillard’s theory of the implosion of ideas. They are self-analysing reflections on early to mid-20th century Western culture, in a way a reversal of Baudrillard’s second order of the simulacra, multiplied and distorted until they result in the form of Baty, a figure of a past with no context, no apparent origin or explanation within the confines of the text. He is the embodiment of what Jean-François Lyotard called the ‘modern neurosis, the Western schizophrenia’ in which we are doomed to a cycle of ‘ana-lysing, ana-mnesing, of reflecting’ upon the past as if it were a mental illness, until through this process of ‘working through’ modernity has yielded progress for society. \ 	Taking this ‘real’ system of ideas as a simulation then, what implications does this raise for the character of Roy Baty, himself a simulated human, in a story that is a simulation of 1960s America, re-envisioned through the introspective lens of Dick’s imagination, and as a figure representing a simulated space and time that never truly existed, yet one that was fundamentally important in shaping the 19th and 20th century societies of the West, the ‘Orient’? Baty stands as a ghost that both surfaces clearly through the ambiguity of the multiple levels of reality and simulation in the text, and is simultaneously obscured within them. Like a Freudian repressed memory, he is a fundamental figure in the make-up of the novel, yet for the most part, as both a literal character and the embodiment of meta-textual meaning, he skirts on the outside of immediate focus, just out of view. There is a passage in Androids in which Deckard realises that ‘he had acquired an overt, incontestable fear toward the principle android’ (145), but this fear has not come out of nothing. The passage goes on to say that ‘it all hung on Baty – had hung on it from the start. Up to now [Deckard] had encountered and retired progressively more ominous manifestations of Baty’, and importantly that ‘[the fear] snared him completely, now that he had let it approach his conscious mind’ (145, my emphasis). \ 	For Deckard then, the renegade androids, indeed all androids he has met until this point, are linked by a thread that is beyond his comprehension, and yet one that is tangible, that has substance. Baty’s perceived ability to reincarnate himself through more and more dangerous forms in Deckard’s life casts him as both a figure of mystical doom, an ‘uncanny harbinger of death’ whose replication haunts Deckard through ‘successive generations’ of android, and as the ultimate embodiment of Deckard’s fears about the androids, the final goal to which his entire career seems to have been striving for. \ 	Viewing him firstly as a repeating figure who Deckard encounters over and over again, the immediate distinction that must be drawn between Baty and the classic Doppelgänger is that he is not a series of characters who should be simply ‘regarded as identical because they look alike’ as in more classical texts, but that he embodies multiple layers of doubling that brings him in line with Baudrillard’s hyperrealism. Regarding androids as a whole, an obvious anxiety that pervades the human characters of the text is that of the blurring of distinctions between the real of organic entities and the falseness of the robotic androids. The seriousness of this concern is such that even androids themselves such as Rachel Rosen express concerns over their own experience of reality, descending at points into philosophical musings such as whether it’s a loss that ‘androids can’t bear children’, and asserting that ‘I’m not alive!’ (146), despite all external appearances suggesting otherwise. The novel’s events take place just as humanity crosses the event horizon into a universe where they can no longer be considered the only known form of life. Finally it seems, humanity has succeeded in creating a true double of itself, albeit one that is still flawed and can be distinguished under fine enough scrutiny. Baty is the highest being in this order of double, this generation of android; as Deckard reasons, all hangs on him. After his death there is no return for either Deckard or humanity as a whole: the generation succeeding the Nexus-6 will presumably be indistinguishable from the real humanity as is suggested at multiple points in the text, and for Deckard personally Baty’s death heralds the crossing over into a new life, spiritually and physically. It seems that Betsy Haung’s distinction between the Roy Baty of Androids and his portrayal as Roy Batty in the film Blade Runner doesn’t quite do him justice. She notes in her essay ‘Premodern Orientalist Science Fictions’ that the Baty of Androids ‘dies an android, no more or less than what he was at the point of his creation’, yet the Batty of the film ‘is both humanised and deified through rather unsubtle associations with Christ such as the dove he dramatically releases prior to his expiration’. Whilst the Baty of the novel’s Christ-like attributes are undoubtedly more subtle, I would argue that to draw such a distinct line between the two characters would be to miss his importance for the greater scope of the narrative. Yes, he dies an android, but just as Christ died as a human it is what follows his death that determines his importance: his resurrection, the next generation of android. After this event, the death of the Nexus-6 as a whole, there is no turning back for humanity, the world (worlds) will forever be changed. Unlike the film, the question left unanswered at the end of the book is not ‘what if I’m an android?’, but ‘what if the androids have become us?’. \ 	The disappearance of this form of double, this false life-form that crudely imitates humanity, will result in the emergence of a new double, but in this instance the double will no longer be distinguishable from the original, as Baudrillard writes: ‘the double [will have] disappeared’ (B). The end point signified by Baty corresponds to the same point at which he says the ‘simulation is impassable, unsurpassable, checkmated, without exteriority’. \ In light of this, questions arise as to what it means for Baty as a figure of the Orient in the novel alongside his other statuses. Huang’s illustration of the West’s portrayal of Eastern workers (in this case Chinese) as ‘mechanised cogs in a mass production machine’ as evoked by images of ‘rows upon rows of uniformed Chinese factory workers’ shown in the West of course allows one possible reading of Baty, however there is far more to Dick’s work than simply transforming a Mongolian, and therefore, all people of the ‘Orient’, into literal machines. Instead, writers such as Donna Haraway provide possible avenues of exploration into what Dick is attempting with Baty. In her essay ‘A Cyborg Manifesto’, she explores the cyborg as both a literary character and emerging entity in the ‘real’ world, and in doing so identifies it as a refuge point for women who have been otherwise trapped in the ‘tradition of racist, male-dominated capitalism’, amongst other such traditions, throughout the course of the 20th and preceding centuries. She, like Baudrillard, sees the ‘boundary between science fiction and social reality [as] an optical illusion’, and that thus the cyborg represents the breaking down of further boundaries, of human and machine, racial differences, and most importantly for her, the gender binary, giving the cyborg the power to truly emancipate women in society. Viewing the android as such, a likewise figure of liberation through ambiguity, gives some motivation to Dick’s work. A cyborg is generally defined as organic material that has been augmented with synthetic technology, such as replacement limbs, or enhancements to naturally existing body systems. In viewing this process as liberating, the human becoming more machine, cannot the reverse process also be a liberation? The boundaries are removed on both sides in either case; one becoming more like the other inevitably redefines both man and machine. For the people of the East then, a disempowered class at the mercy of the same forces identified by Haraway, this figure of the android can offer the same route to breaking those systems of power and gaining self-autonomy over a Western-centric global economy. In Baty’s life he was forever the strange outsider, seeking his own freedom yet ultimately unable to escape the desires of those who ‘created’ him, being unable even to define himself as an individual, all the information and opinions about him being provided through other characters in the narrative. Through his death, we witness the death of that powerlessness, with the promise that in the future the balance of those forces will be evened out between android and human. \ Given that Baudrillard sees our ‘“real world”’ (B) as a hyperreality, one that cannot be separated from that of fiction, the implications for Dick’s story are enlarged immensely when viewed through his eyes. If indeed ‘it is the map now precedes the territory’ instead of the reverse, as Baudrillard claims in his essay ‘The Procession of Simulacra’, then one could view Androids not only as a story that contains elements of a future emancipation, but one that ultimately acts towards creating that reality through its very existence. The powers of his literary ideas ultimately move beyond the confines of the text and provide the possibility of figures with similar properties to Haraway’s cyborgs. This exploration into ambiguity, tracing the lines of the real and non-real, reveals dangerous possibilities in what these androids could be, yet most importantly, doing so whilst explicitly asking for whom that danger exists, and how these transformations will inevitably take place. \ In Freud’s reading of The Sandman, he concludes early on that ‘in Hoffmann’s tale the sense of the uncanny attaches directly to the figure of the Sand-Man, and therefore to the idea of being robbed of one’s eyes’, and that any ‘intellectual uncertainty’ regarding the doll Olympia is ‘quite irrelevant in the case of this more potent example of the uncanny’. In his later notes, he relegates her importance in the story to that of ‘a materialization of Nathaniel’s feminine attitude to his father in his early childhood’ (160). Thus for Freud, she is nothing more than an extension of Nathaniel’s castration complex, and his love for her is purely ‘narcissistic’ (160) in this sense; there is no more to it than that. Yet she is also one of only two prominent female characters within the story, and notably she is the false female, ‘a work’ rather than an authentic woman. The lack of acknowledgement of this key fact within Freud’s argument highlights an area whose psychoanalytic exploration would likely yield some merit in uncovering the uncanny elements of this text that he may have ignored. \ 	Firstly, it is important to define exactly, or exactly as possible, what Olympia is, namely: a performance of femininity, an artificial ideal as constructed by the men Spalanzani and Coppola, and later on to whom Nathaniel projects his own ideal of femininity, as opposed to the ‘inanimate, accursed automaton’ (S) of his authentic fiancée Clara. She is, for Spalanzani as well as the other men of the story, a taming of that feminine, a controlling through appropriation of that ‘[uncanniness] about the female genitals’ (151) that Freud describes as having been felt by his neurotic male patients. In a slightly later work, Some Psychical Consequences of the Anatomical Distinction between the Sexes, Freud addresses directly this issue of unease felt by men for women and their difference in genitalia. The editor’s note makes reference to a description Freud made in an even later pamphlet of adult female sexuality as ‘a “dark continent” for psychology’, or more specifically, to his male-focused psychology. This ‘dark continent’ also encompasses the unknown nature of the female genitalia and the reaction that its discovery has on infant boys. Initially, Freud says, the boy shows ‘irresolution and a lack of interest’ towards the difference in genitals. He goes on to explain that: \ ‘It is not until later, when some threat of castration has obtained a hold upon him, that the observation becomes important to him: if he then recollects or repeats it, it arouses a terrible storm of emotion in him and forces him to believe in the reality of the threat [of castration] that he hitherto laughed at.’ \ Following the trade instigated by Coppola of Nathaniel’s eyes for the ‘constructed telescope’ (S) and the setting of those eyes within the doll, he sees her filled with ‘constantly increasing life' (S), at last able to move and become that which women should be according to this model of male infantile development. Having been endowed with Nathaniel’s removed eyes, Olympia has been restored to a state of pre-castration, the supposed original state in which the female existed before she became a ‘mutilated creature’ from a male perspective. And, following the removal of those eyes by ‘the Sand-man […], the dreaded father, at whose hands castration is expected’ (140), she returns to a lifeless doll, proving that indeed all life does flow from that other ‘precious […] organ’ (140), and that men are justified in feeling an uncanniness about any human being without it, the ‘doubt as to whether an apparently animate object really is alive’ (135). \ For Nathaniel, this means Olympia embodies the perfect 'Other' to his 'subject', namely: she provides a safe and 'untroubling' partner for him, whilst holding none of the 'mystery and unknowability' found in natural women. Freud's analysis was obviously made many decades before Judith Butler's theories of gender and its role in relationships, however both reference the pervasive idea of female as Other to the male, and it is here that Freud's dismissal of Olympia as nothing more than a 'complex that has been detached from Nathaniel' (160) is less than convincing. If, as Butler suggests, the 'interiority [of gender] is an effect and function of a decidedly public and social discourse', then Olympia’s exterior appearance of an attractive female is a result of this, her own 'interiority' being comprised of nothing but clockwork. The inexplicable draw Nathaniel feels toward this woman, expressed in the way that he looks to her 'involuntarily' (S) after having been given Coppola’s telescope, can be assigned to this effect. Having been defused of the repressed fear that exists for other 'castrated' females, there is nothing in the way of Nathaniel assigning to her the traits and beliefs that he feels appropriate to compliment his own feelings, even when the only expression he gets out of her is the continuous 'Ah, ah!' (S). \ Despite all this, Olympia is simultaneously a thing that both should and should not exist. On the one hand she is the rectification of the cause of the repressed male feelings of ‘horror’ and ‘contempt’ felt since childhood for the female, yet at the same time she is an illusion, an impossible possibility. Within her body she merges the male and female; the ‘Heimlich […] with its antonym unheimlich’ (134). The two are held within each other, and this goes some way towards further explaining why the majority of the characters within The Sandman ‘find [Olympia] quite uncanny, and prefer to have nothing to do with her’ (S). The safety she offers the disturbed Nathaniel is countered at all times by the fantastic nature of her being. She is in every sense a 'fantasy of a fantasy', the imagined construction of a gender that is not stable in the first place, and whose instability is the cause of the trouble feared by Freud's neurotic patients. Echoing the women within Freud’s anecdote in The Uncanny regarding his experience in an Italian red light district, Olympia is a display of ‘sexual otherness that is rendered unthreatening’. Highlighted by Robin Lydenberg as an example where Freud himself both ‘represses and expresses highly charged material’ through his dual role as narrator and subject, this ‘[voyage] of discovery’ (144) described by Freud exposes his own fears, and thus the fears of men generally, regarding female sexuality. The duality of simultaneous expression and repression appears to be an inescapable aspect of the displayed, performative woman when encountered by men used to the ‘[construction of] subject and Other, that binary relation between “men” and “women”’. It both allows the cementation of the male norm as opposed to the female in sexual relationships whilst ‘expos[ing] his autonomy as illusory’. The cost of this new power is the acknowledgement that it is not a permanent state of affairs: that the infantile horror may at any time be returned. \ Comparing these ideas with those put forward by Freud in The Uncanny regarding Olympia and the ‘disquieting power of [her] and her two fathers’, there is more that can be said on the relationship between her and Nathaniel, and of Nathaniel’s castration complex and its role in the uncanny elements within this story. There is a key paragraph in the text of The Sandman that Freud mentions in an extended note at the back of his essay that addresses the issue of altered bodies and the Sandman's abilities in this area. When Nathaniel was discovered spying by the lawyer Coppelius, he says that Coppelius exclaimed: 'Well, let the lad have his eyes and do his share of the world's crying, but we will examine the mechanism of his hands and feet', and then that he 'seized me so roughly that my joints cracked, and screwed off my hands and feet, afterwards putting them back again, one after another' and mumbled: 'There's something wrong here, […] but now it's as good as ever. The old man has caught the idea!’ (S). Here Hoffman foreshadows the story's later events regarding the doll Olympia and introduces early the idea of human being as a constructed entity. Coppelius treats Nathaniel as if he were an automaton himself, removing his limbs and trying them out in different places, admiring the mechanism of his body’s design. This power to remove Nathaniel's limbs at will, which Freud reads as the ‘equivalent of castration’ (160), transforms Coppelius into a father figure for Nathaniel, one who continues to hold the power of castration over him throughout the story even after his natural father's death. Freud doesn’t simply ‘dismiss’ the importance of Coppelius as a second father in the narrative as Marie-Helene Huet claims. He explicitly notes that this scene introduces powers that ‘[fall] quite outside anything we know about the Sand-Man’, and recognises that this splits Nathaniel’s ‘father-imago’ into ‘two opposing parts; the one [that] threatens him with blinding (castration), while the other, the good father, successfully intercedes for his sight’ (160). \ Importantly, Freud finds in this dual fatherhood an instance of simultaneous repression and expression, and associates this with Nathaniel’s own unresolved castration complex. He finds that ‘the piece of the complex that is most subject to repression, the death-wish directed against the bad father, finds expression in the death of the good father, for which Coppelius bears the blame’ (160). His linking of these two figures as the precursors to the ‘reincarnations’ (160) of Coppola and Spalanzani imbues all four of them with the disquieting power that Huet talks about. This is furthered through the highlighted series of cause and effect between Nathaniel’s thoughts and the resulting death of his natural father, an example of the uncanny described by Freud as ‘the omnipotence of thoughts’ (147). Though Coppelius receives the blame for killing the father, it is the guilt of Nathaniel’s original thought, and the subsequent repression of this memory, that causes the death of his father to haunt him ‘like dark clouds which no friendly sunbeam can penetrate’ (S). Coppelius is simply the agent of this desire, not its originator: the ‘uncanny harbinger of death’ (142) who remains hidden but ever-present in Nathaniel’s life. \ This casting of Coppelius as an alterer of things rather than an originator is confirmed following his investigation of the mechanism of Nathaniel’s limbs. Following this deconstruction of the boy’s body, he exclaims 'the old man has caught the idea!', which is rendered in the original German as: 'Der Alte hat's verstanden!', 'Der Alte' in this sense meaning God, the original creator whom the satanic Coppelius is attempting to imitate.  Coppelius is a giver of life, but he is also a remover, and in him the two processes are incorporated into one another, an instance of the ‘repetition compulsion’ that Freud sees as being central to the story. Nathaniel's natural father's knowing acceptance of his own fate, saying in 'a faint, broken voice' that '[Coppelius] is coming for the last time' (S) before the event, also confirms that this is an integral part of his process. As a fellow researcher into the strange alchemic world to which Coppelius belongs, Nathaniel's father knows that his life must be given for the work he has done, a Faustian trade-off from which he cannot escape. Again, there is a compounded repetition of supernatural forces cultivating in the father’s death, multiple returns to the same inevitable conclusion in much the same way Freud endlessly returned to that Italian street. It seems that it is simultaneously the father and the son’s fault, a recurrence of ‘the same destinies, the same misdeeds […] through successive generations’ (142). Coppelius’ drawing of Nathaniel to his own death shows this: in both cases, their actions are done of their ‘own accord’ (S), yet it is Coppelius who is the executor of their deaths.  \ 	Freud’s analysis demonstrates what Jean-Michel Rey, G. W. Most and James Hulbert describe as ‘literature [that] softens, veils, [and] clothes what it exposes’. In uncovering the various aspects of the uncanny within the work, Freud himself exposes the workings of literature within his psychoanalytic framework, whilst also veiling certain aspects of his own biases and problems as explored here. This does not mean, however, that he claims the ‘narrative itself’ is ‘reduced […] to this operation’ as Rey et al. claim. Freud makes it very clear in The Sandman that writers are able to ‘produce very different effects with the same material’, and that ultimately a greater understanding is ‘no doubt’ held by ‘experts in aesthetics’ (158). From the outset of this essay, he makes it clear that he is merely ‘[taking] an interest in a particular field of aesthetics’ (123), and that his ultimate aim is simply a ‘modest contribution, which is therefore presented to the reader with no claim of priority’ (124). With this in mind, Freud’s writings on the uncanny within The Sandman highlight previously unseen aspects that would likely have remained otherwise hidden were it not for the unique perspective of psychoanalytic thought, even if it is a generalisation to say that those concerned with aesthetics ‘on the whole prefer to concern themselves with our feelings for the beautiful, the grandiose and the attractive […] rather than with their opposites, feelings of repulsion and distress’ (123). \ 	Further criticising Freud, Rey et al. note that he ‘does not notice the central function of the curtain in “The Sandman,”’, referring to the numerous instances in which curtains are literally used as devices for veiling, hiding the young Nathaniel from his father and Coppelius, and obscuring the doll Olympia. This lack of comprehensiveness does nothing to weaken the arguments made by those engaged in psychoanalytic analysis. Whilst he does not identify every instance of the uncanny within the text, Freud’s readings remain important and valid within the Western literary canon. What it does however show is that the initial psychoanalytic readings of texts from the early 20th Century did have much that needed to be built on. The inclusion of Freud’s work into that of later writers, such as Judith Butler, allowed theories such as Feminism and Queer Theory a ground point from which new and contemporary conclusions could be drawn, and as such the limitations of psychoanalytic theory and its early proponents should not be viewed as a fundamental weakness, but as areas of research that are able to be built upon. \ The fiction that Philip K. Dick wrote in the 1970s, the last decade of his life, comprising the novel A Scanner Darkly as well as the ‘VALIS Trilogy’ demonstrated a definite turn from the science fiction for which he was best known towards a more explicitly autobiographical project. The numerous references to his life and other works within the texts concerned, as well as the sheer volume of other material in which he draws links between his own life and its depiction within his work, comprised of letters, essays, as well as the recently published The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick—which, at close-to 950 pages long, still only scratches the surface of the ‘eight-thousand-plus pages’ of notes and other material that comprised the ‘manuscript’ in which he documented those last ten years—provides ample material for anyone attempting to establish ‘influences’ behind the work. Indeed, under the shadow of such an array of material attempting to blur these boundaries, it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between the two. This has led some critics to exacerbation, claiming among other things that one simply cannot get past ‘the author’s admission that he believes in Valis, or rather, Philip K. Dick’s admission that he believes in it’, and that ‘by this somewhat shocking or embarrassing tactic, the novel defeats our attempt to defend ourselves by saying that it is only a novel’. \ 	The ‘weariness’ felt by Christopher Palmer is understandable; I will, however, in my reading attempt to go somewhat beyond it. In his essay attempting to pose the question ‘What is an Author?’, Michel Foucault notes that: \ It is well known that in a novel narrated in the first person, neither the first person pronoun, the present indicative tense, nor, for that matter, its signs of localization refer directly to the writer […] rather, they stand for a “second self” whose similarity to the author is never fixed and undergoes considerable alteration within the course of a single book. \ The disjoint marked here between the subject of the writing author and that of their narrating character, following on from Roland Barthes’ assertion that ‘life never does more than imitate the book’, is where I locate my own departure from any attempt to reconcile the antagonism between work and author that Palmer highlights. \ 	For in work such as this, ‘with its ambiguous generic and institutional status—at once SF [science fiction], autobiography, and pop hermeneutic of the late-capitalist everyday—and its uneasy assimilation of the subject of delirium to the narrating subject’, attempting to pigeon-hole and disband all problematic elements under the banner of authorial presence would be to do it a great disservice. Scott Durham in his examination of Dick’s late work poses the pursuit of the ‘subject(s)’ of these late novels; it is to these, following on from Palmer’s investigation, that I turn my attention. \ 	My approach will be thus: I will first examine the character of Dick’s dual narrator/subject within the first book of the ‘VALIS Trilogy’, VALIS, and attempt to formulate from this point-of-entry a theoretical framework that may be utilised in order to approach the other subjects of the trilogy and their relationships with the narrative order. Following on from this, and drawing upon Lacan’s ‘Seminar on the Purloined Letter’, I will examine instances of ‘repetition automatism’ within the ‘VALIS Trilogy’, and demonstrate that these constitute a symbolic chain whose prevalence within all three books traps the characters within the demands of these symptomatic repetitions. In the final chapter of my essay, I will further reconcile the two strains of my argument by examining how Dick’s subjects operate within this symbolic order according to a single desire, and offer criticism on the problematic constitution of sexual difference that this pursuit establishes within the texts. \ 	 \ I \ A Subject of Division \  1. One Mind there is; but under it two principles contend. \ VALIS is a novel which begins with a disavowal. Within the first few pages, the reader is introduced to the narrator, Phil, and his friend Horselover Fat. Phil, we are told, is actually Philip K. Dick, a ‘science fiction writer’ by profession, and, compounding this peculiar introduction, he is also Horselover Fat. A portmanteau of the Greek translation of ‘Philip’ (Horselover) and the German translation of ‘Dick’ (Fat), this comically named character is a cast-off portion of the narrator, written by Phil in the third person in order to ‘gain much-needed objectivity’ (11). Thus, we the readers are left with a number of questions regarding our narrator: How do we approach this split? Is this introduction a sign of roman à clef, or is it simply post-modern word-games? What is it, precisely, that this rupture draws our attention to?  \ Turning to the novel’s content: who is it that is ‘speaking’ in VALIS? An answer might be found by looking at the language that surrounds that initial disavowal. Within the first chapter, a certain tone is set regarding the descriptions of Fat that remains prescient throughout the book: a tone of both mockery and superiority, depicting him as not only separate from Phil, but as some sort of inferior double. \ 	Thus, when describing him, Phil says that Fat’s mind is ‘defective’ (44), that he has ‘lost touch with reality’ (113), that it is no wonder his ex-wife treated him terribly because she ‘could not be expected to take on the crushing problems that Fat had created’ (56). And in this relationship Phil not only finds fault in what Fat is doing, he goes so far as to blame some far more fundamental character flaw for his deteriorating mental state, ascribing it to Fat’s own desire to hurt himself. He says that Fat ‘could hardly wait’ (92) to ‘go forth and abolish himself’ after his divorce, that ‘part of Fat desired to die’ (141). \ This comes to a head when Phil describes how Fat begins to regularly visit his friend Sherri, who is in hospital undergoing cancer treatment, because he’d ‘deluded’ (87) himself into thinking that he felt a sense of ‘charity’ towards her. Instead, Phil tells us that Fat’s true motivation was that ‘actually he had become horny’. Thus, when Fat ‘bind[s] himself’ (83) to her, knowing full well that when she dies she ‘planned to take as many people with her as possible’, his desire for sex becomes entangled with a desire for pain and, ultimately, death. Phil says that in her battle with cancer, Sherri begins to enjoy the threat of remission, and the pain that she is able to cause to other people because of her condition. The implication is that Fat too is forced into a masochistic embrace by this situation, actively colluding in the actions she takes against him in order to ‘lessen his own sense of impotence’ (88). \ 	This is very telling. It is clear throughout that Phil, also, enjoys the process of Fat’s decline. Despite having conversations with Fat directly at multiple points, he never attempts to assist him, or to offer advice regarding the many faults that he pulls up before the reader. The very fact of Fat’s lack of agency, his impacted control over his place within the narrative, is present in the very form by which the text is delivered: at no point does Fat, despite sharing the same body as Phil, gain the ability to ‘narrate’ the story. When the two characters are temporarily ‘rejoined’ (220), we are left with Phil alone: ‘Fat was gone. Nothing remained of him’ (212-3). But of course, he is not simply gone, he remains very much ‘alive in me [Phil]’, only to re-emerge later. He has simply been repressed; Phil’s sense of feeling ‘whole’ by himself, without Fat, is an illusion. \ 	The fragmentation of these two characters, and their relationship to one another, reflects Lacan’s expansion of Freud’s initial delineation of the elements of the psyche, in which he determined the categories of ideal-ego, the ego-ideal, and the super-ego. For Lacan, the ideal-ego is an ‘idealized mirror-image of my ego’; the image I form of myself in the mirror stage of childhood development that I aspire towards. The ego-ideal is this image reversed: it is how I view myself from the perspective of that ideal-ego, with all of the ‘narcissistic satisfaction’ that such an idealised version of myself would embody. It constitutes the demands placed upon the subject by their interaction with what he calls the Symbolic level of human experience, the ‘system of differences and arbitrary identifications through which (for Lacan) all human society is constructed’. Finally, the super-ego is this gaze in its ‘necessary obverse’ manifestation, ‘the cruel and insatiable agency that bombards me with impossible demands and then mocks my botched attempts to meet them’. In VALIS, Phil, I argue, comes to us from that very position. \ 	When viewed in this light, the narrativistic structure of the novel is itself inverted entirely. Rather than a story told from the perspective of the ‘sane’ portion of a clearly divided subject, narrating elegiacally the ‘slow decline into depression and psychosis and isolation’ (20) of the ‘mad’ portion of his psyche, the novel is instead a grossly distorted account told from the perspective of a malignant and calculated agency who derives pleasure from this suffering. Further than this, it not only derives pleasure, but actively demands it: ‘the superego is the imperative of jouissance – Enjoy!’ The key word Lacan uses here is ‘imperative’: it is an enforced pleasure, of the sort that can be seen when Phil tells us he and his friends ‘enjoyed baiting Fat into theological disputation because he always got angry’ (28), and that they’d happily while away the time ‘pleasantly in this fashion, torturing Fat in a benign way’ (my emphasis). Through his relationship with Phil, Fat is forced to take pleasure in his own mockery. Returning to Phil’s earlier observation regarding Fat’s ‘impotence’, we can see illustrated Lacan’s comment that ‘the superego […] is a correlate of castration’. \ 	What do I mean by this? In approaching the character of Phil/Fat, we have a man whose super-ego element has become the primary identity, the one with the power of narration, of agency, etc. One of the psychiatrists that he sees in the course of the novel, Dr. Stone, points this out clearly for us in his identification of Fat’s dilemma: ‘My diagnosis is that those are the three areas where you have blocks: fear, helplessness and an inability to act’ (65). This symbolic castration has become the constitutive aspect of his identity. \ 	With such a pronounced division of self, something that was maintained for a long period of time—Phil’s friends, after his temporary ‘reincorporation’ of Fat, tell him: ‘we all kept hoping, but it seemed as if – you know. As if you’d never heal’ (219), referring to him ‘believing in Horselover Fat as a separate person’—we might pose the question of how the text attempts to reconcile these two antagonistic identities. If we turn back to the novel that Dick wrote before the ‘VALIS Trilogy’, A Scanner Darkly, we can see that here, too, Dick explores the idea of a divided subject. The novel’s protagonist, Bob Arctor, is an undercover narcotics agent who, through a combination of administrative oversight and the necessary secrecy of his dual-identity, which is unknown to those even within his own agency in order to protect his safety, is assigned to spy and report on himself. As the novel goes on, the deterioration of his cognitive functions, a side-effect of the large amounts of the drug ‘substance D’ he must take in his life as a doper, serves to only further blur the boundaries between these two selves that he maintains, until, inevitably, he breaks down and is left a husk of a person. \ 	Regarding this split subject, Paul Youngquist comments that: \ In splitting Arctor’s identity Dick is not suggesting that the human psyche us inherently divided against itself, half dangerous, desiring doper, half rational, upstanding narc. He is suggesting instead that such differences function to reinforce the legitimacy of the capitalist real. […] Arctor faces a dilemma that Oedipus never knew, that of a radical undecidability between identities that both seem real. \ Focusing on that issue of ‘undecidability’, Youngquist goes on ask: ‘Why then the enormous energy devoted to distinguishing between them?’ We might ask this same question of VALIS. It draws our attention to the act of division, of this subject attempting to divide and dissolve himself at seemingly great cost. \ 	Durham asks this question of how a dissolving subject can legitimately narrate his own dissolution. In Scanner, ‘the double bind confronted by Fred/Bob might be characterised as the imperative to construct a collective memory for an experience which counts the destruction of memory as one of its essential components’, a conflict that is resolved ‘only at the price of identifying with the very repressive apparatus that the experience was supposed to combat in the first place’. In VALIS however, he argues that Dick takes a different approach toward the same problem: ‘Dick’s theological novels attempt to resolve this contradiction by sheer force of desire, presenting us with a jubilatory and delirious reinvestment of the repressive apparatus which carries him beyond the generic protocols of SF.’ The result of this, Durham argues, is those instances in the novel in which we see Phil begin to find meaning in nearly all mundane occurrences around him, from hidden messages in juxtaposed television commercials (252-3), to, we might extrapolate, the ‘beer can’ in the ‘gutter’ (167) that occurs numerous times in the text and is taken as a sign of God’s omnipresence. As Jean-Nöel Dumont puts it, in these books ‘everything is sign. Knowledge and liturgy both draw our attention to signs. In this world subject to forgetfulness and to matter, the spirit can recognize signs; it receives messages, is visited by angels’. \ 	Durham’s idea of this massive force of desire, that subsequently invests the world surrounding the subject with manifold meaning, is something I will now explore further. First, taking this investment of signs, or, to return to Lacan, the Symbolic, with such importance, I will look at elements that recur across the three texts of the ‘VALIS Trilogy’ that defer to the power of this realm. Secondly, I will examine this force of desire, for all three of Dick’s ‘narrator/subjects’ are constituted by the same symbolic castration that is found in Phil/Fat, and likewise this is how they attempt to go beyond this, as Durham highlights. \ II \ A Subject of Repetition \ 31. We hypostatize information into objects. Rearrangement of objects is change in the content of the information; the message has changed. This is a language which we have lost the ability to read. We ourselves are a part of this language; changes in us are changes in the content of the information. We ourselves are information-rich; information enters us, is processed and is then projected outward once more, now in an altered form. We are not aware that we are doing this, that in fact this is all we are doing. \ The passage from one book into the next is not a ‘clean’ one, is not one with the naturalism of one logical step to the next: it carries with it an ‘excess’, a ‘trace’ that problematizes a straight, sequential reading of the trilogy and demands an analysis of those aspects that constitute this remainder. The first point of interest that I identify: Philip K. Dick, a man for whom the sequel was not a comfortable mode, as evidenced by his struggles with and failure to write a sequel to his book The Man in the High Castle, has here, with the ‘VALIS Trilogy’, revisited a work majorly for the first time in his canon and written for it a successor. In fact, The Divine Invasion is the third book in this particular narrative line of enquiry: VALIS was itself a re-written version of a full draft that was rejected by Dick’s publishers, whose essential plot was then appropriated in that rewrite and appeared within VALIS as a film seen by the characters mid-way through, also titled ‘Valis’. This draft was later published posthumously in its original form under the title Radio Free Albemuth. \ 	To say then, that the lineage of VALIS and Invasion is ‘messy’, would not be saying enough. This difficult birth has left many pertinent scars, and by tracing these, I argue, we may reveal certain obscured aspects of the narratives’ construction. For Invasion and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer are not simply logical follow-ons from the questions posited by VALIS, they are instead fundamentally repetitions of this primary text, in which the subjects are recast but the fundamental structure that underlies their relationship to one another and acts as a catalyst for the plot remains unchanged. The three books are linked by a chain of signs that recur in a manner akin to those of the Edgar Allen Poe story The Purloined Letter, famously examined by Lacan, ‘in a form so characteristic in their apparent gratuitousness that they might validly be compared to the return of the repressed’. \ 	Allow me to backtrack a little and present my working. In his essay Endopsychic Allegories, Laurence A. Rickels associates Invasion with Dick’s attempt to ‘give the Fantasy genre a final reckoning as the ongoing temptation he could only overcome by turning, as he does in this novel over the spectral issue of the dead, to science fiction’. We may read it as telling that the bulk of the novel is explicitly set in this way within different worlds of fantasy. For the first half of the book, the protagonist Herb Asher is held in cryonic suspension following a mid-air flycar collision that has left him mortally injured and in need of a spleen transplant. However, much like the state of ‘half-life’ in Dick’s earlier novel Ubik, during this state of suspension Asher is conscious even when he technically shouldn’t be: ‘I dreamed. I didn’t know that people in cryonic suspension where conscious’, he tells the doctor upon being finally re-awoken ten years later; ‘you weren’t’, replies the doctor, and the reader is left with a classic Dickian uncertainty over the ‘objective’ status of the narrative told up until this point. \ 	It is during this first half of the novel that the omniscient narrator tells the events that have led up to the ‘present day’ of the narrative through the guise of the ‘limited world [that] stretched out of an archaic nature’ (9) in Asher’s ‘frozen brain’; we are given one run of the dream that we are told repeats ‘again and again’ (121) throughout the course of his coma. The narration itself, whilst being in the third person, is also tied to the ‘vantage point of the central or focal character’ that then ‘colours and limits the subsequent narration’ as Darko Suvin describes as being common in Dick’s work. As such, we cannot know if what we have been told is representative of the novel’s true history, or is merely a continuation of the ‘flight into Fantasy’ that otherwise characterises the arc of the book’s narrative. Upon leaving cryo stasis ten years later, during which time the rest of the cast has grown up significantly, the novel advances less than thirty pages before once again plunging into a different fantasy world, this time that of ‘The Secret Commonwealth’ (142). A phantastmatic simulacrum of the world whose history ‘branched off [from the ‘real’ world] at crucial points’ (165), and whose name refers to the 17th century work of Scottish fairy folklore by Robert Kirk, the characters are drawn into this universe and it is here that the remainder of the novel is set. The subsequent course of events consist of this ‘beautiful dream’ (163) world being transmuted into the real world as the ‘divine child’ Emanuel ‘bestow[s] actually onto [it]’ (165). \ 	The plot of the novel then is inseparable from this play of fantasy; the border between real and imaginary is never clear and remains permeable. But this does not necessitate that at its core is the same story as VALIS as I have argued. In order to demonstrate this, I propose to approach the concept of fantasy in a strict Lacanian sense, and recognise that ‘phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary, something determinant in the function of repetition’. Beneath the multi-tiered levels of fantasy within this book lies a repetition automatism that is constituted of the same narrative elements as is found in VALIS. \ 	Examining the protagonists of the stories first, there are I argue five major positions occupied by the characters with regard to their place within the plot and their relationships with one another, positions which recur across the novels via ‘a repetition automatism in the sense that interests us in Freud’s text’: the straight-man ‘narrator/subject’ (Phil in VALIS, Asher in Invasion, Angel in Transmigration), this being the primary protagonist and locus of the narrative; their ‘religious manic’ opposite number (Fat in VALIS, Elias Tate in Invasion, Timothy Archer in Transmigration), who serve as the exponents of the texts’ racing religious hermeneutics; the ‘ill woman’, the death drive embodied, who blocks the ‘narrator/subject’ from their object of desire (Sherry in VALIS, Rybys in Invasion, Kirsten in Transmigration); the ‘divine child saviour’ (Sophia in VALIS, Emmanuel in Invasion, Bill in Transmigration), figures through whom the ‘narrator/subjects’ attempt to reach their object of desire; and, finally, ‘the object of desire’ itself, (Gloria in VALIS, Linda Fox in Invasion, Timothy Archer, who serves both this role as well as that of the ‘religious manic’ in Transmigration). \ 	The basic plot of the interplay of these narrative positions, which occur initially in VALIS and recur in both Invasion and Transmigration, such that they ‘may be considered its repetition’, are as follows. The ‘narrator/subject’, constituted as they are by a primary castration, attempts to gain for themselves their ‘object of desire’. This however, proves unsuccessful, as it is in all cases an impossible desire (in VALIS and Transmigration, both ‘objects’ are dead; in Invasion, she is a famous intergalactic singer). However, to the ‘narrator/subject’ this desire does appear to be within reach, and at some point in all three novels it seems to them that the ‘ill woman’ is the force that is responsible for frustrating their desire by positioning herself within their relationship with their object and displacing them. Finally, the ‘narrator/subject’ turns to the deus ex machina of the (literally) ‘divine child saviour’ in order to subvert the ‘ill woman’ and reach their ‘object of desire’, an aim that is only partially successful in all three novels. The ‘religious manic’, though they play various parts within the novels’ plots and repeat in a symptomatic manner akin to the other positions I am describing, are of more interest to those attempting to examine the dizzying religious ideas that are put forward in the text. As such, I will not be touching upon them futher. \ 	Let us examine in more detail these instances of plot. In VALIS, the ‘ill woman’ Sherry lives with Phil/Fat, and we are led to understand that he pursues her because she fills the place of his ‘object of desire’, Gloria, whose suicide prompted his ‘long decline into misery and illness’ (11). We are told that ‘Gloria, upon smashing herself to bits on the pavement […] had been reborn twice the size’ (90-1) in the figure of Sherry, and that while ‘he would love her’ because ‘that was a good thing to do’, all that Sherry could see in her life was ‘impending pain and death over which she had no control’, and that this is why she rejects his attempts at a relationship and eventually leaves him. Left afloat by himself, Phil/Fat and his friends undergo a journey to locate Sophia, the ‘divine child savour’. She seems to temporarily resolve his problems: ‘she healed me’ (219), Phil says. Sophia’s death however reverses this process, and once again Fat emerges as a split-off segment of Phil and begins searching anew for the next incarnation of Christ. We are told that, after all, ‘all that had saved [Fat] after Sherri died was his decision to go in search of the ‘fifth Savior’’ (243). \ In Invasion, Asher begins alone ‘in his dome in the star system CY30-CY30B’ (10) and facing the possibility that his ‘mind has gone, due to isolation’ (13), and it is through ‘hang[ing] on to the Fox’ (28), via recordings of her music, that he is able to stay sane. He and the ‘ill woman’ Rybys are later forced into marriage in order that they may return to Earth, yet their relationship is never consummated; it is a marriage of necessity. When the characters enter The Secret Commonwealth, Rybys is resurrected from the dead and she is re-imagined as his ‘bitter and sardonic’ (Invasion, 199) wife of many years, and a direct obstacle between Asher and the suddenly attainable Linda Fox. Zina, another divine character, has remade Linda Fox within this world as a means to ‘[fulfil] his wishes’ (162-3). However, this Linda Fox remains a ‘fake’ image, one who does not satisfy him. It is the ‘divine child saviour’ Emmanuel, whose power is ‘the most precious gift of all: reality’, that finally accomplishes this, though only within the world of The Secret Commonwealth. \ In Transmigration, the ‘narrator/subject’ Angel desires the ‘object’ of her father-in-law, Bishop Timothy Archer: his mistress and friend of Angel’s, the ‘ill woman’ Kirsten, snaps ‘you think with your crotch’ at her, regarding Angel’s interest in him; his invitation to Angel to fly with him to Israel as his secretary is initially misinterpreted by her ‘Christ, […] I thought you meant as your mistress’ (201), she says; later, even the mentally ill Bill, whose social skills are severely impaired, notes to her that ‘Tim had a crush on you’ (229). However, it is Kirsten who becomes Timothy Archer’s mistress: they become ‘spiritually married’ (225) in secret, but cannot publically declare their relationship. In a reverse of the events of VALIS, the ‘ill woman’ takes the desired place of the ‘narrator/subject’ within this structure, rather than that of the lost ‘object of desire’, however she is still the key element of frustration. At the novel’s conclusion, when both Kirsten and Timothy are dead, it is to the schizophrenic Bill—whose innocence causes Angel to repeatedly refer to him in terms such as ‘this sweet kind baby’ (92), and ‘this child’, and who is referred to by the pop-guru Barefoot as ‘a bodhisattva’ (217), ‘one who has turned down his chance to attain Nirvana in order to turn back to help others’—that Angel turns to in an attempt to fill the void left by the death of her friends. He appears to begin channelling the spirit of the dead Timothy: ‘I am Tim Archer, […] I have come back from the other side. To those I love’ (226), he says to her. This happens with such uncanny turn-of-phrase that Angel, despite her doubts, resolves to take in this ‘divine child saviour’ that she may have her ‘object’ in some form. \ In all three books, we can see how these elements of symptomatic repetition constitute a chain of ‘repetition automatism’ that revolves around the ‘narrator/subject’s pursuit of their ‘object of desire’. And that these objects are not simply frivolous wants, they are in fact the very things by which the ‘narrator/subject’ becomes orientated within this Symbolic space in the novels. John P. Muller and William J. Richardson write that ‘what determines the Freudian subject for Lacan is of a “symbolic” nature […] and that the symbolic order (with all its “laws”) is autonomous’, and it is in this precise sense I argue that these subjects are operating. Lacan himself wrote that ‘what Freud teaches us […] is that the subject must pass through the channels of the symbolic, but what is illustrated here is […] the subjects […] more docile than sheep, model their very being on the moment of the signifying chain which traverses them’. \ Like those subjects of Lacan’s analysis, we can see how this meta-textual chain orchestrates the various characters whilst remaining itself intact. It is in this way that we may consider these repeating elements in a manner akin to that of the psychoanalytic symptom, and that in this case, like that in Freud’s writing, ‘repetition is not [we may say, simply] reproduction’. The recurrence of these signs within the texts cannot be reduced to a simple thematic rehashing; the texts do not openly present themselves as the same story told in two different lights. The repetition of these elements occurs ‘as if by chance’ (emphasis Lacan’s), and they constitute, like those elements of the Poe analysis, a ‘signifying chain’ whose ‘insistence’ traps the apparently free acting characters. Further than this, we will find that this chain, the Symbolic order of these texts, not only traps them but is actively ‘constitutive for the subject’, because of the ‘decisive orientation which the subject receives from the itinerary of a signifier’. \ The repetition of these signs then, I argue, reveals to us both an avenue for interpretation whilst also simultaneously designating the ‘limit of interpretation’. The question they demand is not why do they repeat; what is their common meaning?, but what is their repetition drawing our attention to?; what Žižek identifies as ‘the force which makes them persist’ from one narrative to another. The answer, I argue, lies within that force of desire, and it is to a deeper analysis of the relationships that this creates that I will direct the final section of my inquiry. \ III \ A Subject of Desire \  41. The Empire is the institution, the codification, of derangement; it is insane and imposes its insanity on us by violence, since its nature is a violent one. \ Late in The Divine Invasion, we see the universe of ‘The Secret Commonwealth’ become slowly manipulated by Emmanuel until at last he can declare that, to Asher, ‘the dream […] is no longer a dream; it is true down to the level of disappointments’ (191). This shift in the reality of the world comes on the back of a wager between the near-omnipotent Emmanuel and Zina, regarding whether Asher will believe in their pop star Linda Fox, with whom he had ‘long maintained an active fantasy live’ (22) as a distant fan, and who they make real before him in the flesh in this alternate world. What we witness is an entire universe revolving around a single man’s desire; where once he relied on her music to stay sane in an isolated off-world colony, now she needs his approval to regard herself as ‘someone important’ (205). Without him, she says, ‘I have such a low opinion of myself; I’m so sure I’m going to fail’. Reduced from her position as an intergalactic superstar in the ‘real world’ to that of a struggling artist recording her debut material in this new one, Herb Asher suddenly becomes the most important person in her life. \ 	However, she remains tied to his fantasy. While he eventually learns to love her warts and all, Asher is initially repulsed by the revelation that ‘Linda Fox has periods and cramps’ (187-90), as well as the fact that she has ‘a little acne’, she ‘burps’, and that she has the dress sense of a ‘pizza waitress’. The thing that remains consistent throughout is that element which Asher was enchanted by in the first place, the ‘dozens of hours of the Fox on audio and video tape’ (28) that he kept in his off-world dome: the power of the Fox’s voice that was the only thing to ‘keep him company’ (13) during the long isolation of his life in CY30-CY30B. Salecl and Žižek speak of the voice, along with other Freudian partial objects, as being Lacanian ‘love objects par excellence—not in the sense that we fall in love with a voice or a gaze, but rather in the sense that they are a medium, a catalyst that sets off love’. We may view the voice of Linda Fox in this light, seeing it not as the locus of Asher’s affection, but as instead a trace, a telling sign which functions as a crack within the character that allows one to glimpse at his desire; ‘that which comes closest to touching the core of the subject whilst at the same time calling that subject’s very centre in to question, revealing it to be inaccessible and empty’. \ In orientating the world of The Secret Commonwealth around Asher’s desire for Linda Fox, we see the disintegration of the sense of the character’s consistency and self-identity, his own presence, being instead replaced by a recognition of his own inadequacy as a subject of desire. Rather than being some sort of autonomous, positive self with the power of agency, he instead is little more than a conduit for the expression of this drive of desire. Why else does it turn out that the Fox is actually Asher’s ‘Advocate’ (235), a divine figure who assists those crossing into the afterlife by taking their place on the day of judgement and substituting their list of sins for her own: ‘a perfectly white piece of paper. A document on which nothing is inscribed’ (130). His inadequacy is ingrained in their very relationship: without her he is fallen, sinful, comprised of a fundamental lack. Once again, as I explored in chapter one, we have a subject of castration. \ This is also true of Dick’s other subjects, in that their coherence is both held-together and subsequently undermined by their reliance on the objects of desire that they pursue. We have seen above how Phil/Fat, as the prototypical protagonist of Dick’s late work, demonstrates the self-division which marks their ambivalence toward their own position. The attempt to reach out, to find something outside themselves in order to rectify these divisions, does no more than further the disintegration of their self as it highlights that symbolic castration which characterises their lack of autonomy within the texts. \ 	Let us look at Asher’s connection with the Fox a little further. This obsession with the Fox’s voice marks their relationship as one specifically referred to in Mladen Dolar’s essay on the topic. For Asher does not just listen to it: he records it; he broadcasts it to his fellow colonists; later he promises to put it out on an FM station that he plans to acquire – simply put, he mediates it, fetishizes it, attempts to control it. Dolar speaks of music, with ‘all its seductive force and irresistible appeal’, as being ‘an attempt to domesticate the object, to turn it into an object of aesthetic pleasure, to put up a screen against what is unbearable in it’. This describes Asher’s attitude perfectly: everything he does, all his efforts, ultimately come down to this attempt to keep away from himself the ‘unbearable’ quality of his object of desire, to exclude these elements of what might be called the ‘real’ Linda Fox in favour of this fantasy. Her music, in this context, actively silences her; we should take note that she does not even write her own lyrics, that her music is actually taken from the 16th century ‘lute songs of John Dowland […] remastered for the world of today’ (Invasion, 10). Because it is taken as an object, it ‘embodies the very impossibility of attaining auto-affection, it introduces the scission, the rupture in the middle of the full presence and refers it to a void’. That void is the castration at the heart of Dick’s ‘narrator/subjects’, and as such they are only constructed ‘in an impossible relation’ with their lost ‘objects’; they hold no ‘self-presence’ of their own. \ Returning to the figure of the ‘ill woman’ within these three texts, we might see how the anxieties of the ‘subject\arrator’s’ lack are projected upon them in a similar fashion as a method of coping with the unresolvable position they are placed in with regards this threat of dissolution. Kaja Silverman’s Lacanian analysis of classic cinema is useful in illustrating this. She notes that ‘like Freud’s little boy, cinema’s male viewer finds the vision of woman’s lack threatening to his own coherence, and fears he will become victim to a similar deprivation’. She goes on to suggest that cinema offers two possible resolutions to this problem: ‘disavowal through fetishism, and avowal accompanied by disparagement.’ We may view both of these mitigating strategies at work within Dick’s books with regards to the women that surround his subjects. \ The first strategy corresponds to the already examined Linda Fox, whose voice like ‘an item of clothing or another part of the female anatomy becomes the locus of a compensatory investment, and substitutes for the organ which is assumed to be missing’, as I’ve already examined. The second, however, I argue may refer exactly to the figure of the ‘ill woman’ within these texts. Silverman defines this further: \ The second of these resolutions has a very different end result, since instead of deflecting attention away from one part of the body to another, it shifts the focus from woman’s “outside” to her “inside”. The transfer is effected through an investigation, which “reveals” that the female subject has either committed a crime for which she has to be punished, or suffered from a crippling illness. Since in either case woman’s castration can be traced back to her own interiority, this resolution of the male viewer’s anxiety permits him to place a maximum distance between himself and the spectacle of lack—to indulge in an attitude of “triumphant contempt” for the “mutilated creature” who is his sexual other. \ This description holds for us each of the elements which occur within Dick’s work. In all three texts, we are told by the ‘narrator/subject’s that their corresponding ‘ill women’ are not only responsible for their own illnesses, but are attempting to destroy those around them through their illnesses. In VALIS, ‘Sherri did not merely plan to get sick again; she like Gloria planned to take as many people with her as possible’ (83). In Invasion we are privy to Asher’s thoughts that Rybys’ ‘perpetual cloud of illness, whether she is conscious or not; it is always with her, always there. She is her own pathogen, infecting herself’ (227), and elsewhere: ‘He thought, You are taking me with you. That’s what this is. This is what is happening. You will not go alone; you will take my spirit with you. And you know’ (28). In Transmigration, Angel thinks with regard to Kirsten: ‘She is going down the drain. Worse, she is not going down the drain alone; her nails are dug deep in us and we go perforce along’ (141). \ 	The inclusion of Angel in this series raises an objection to my argument that I will attempt here to satisfy. Angel is, of course, a female ‘narrator/subject’, one whose conception came off the back of a string of criticisms made against Dick by fellow science fiction writer Ursula Le Guin at a public lecture: ‘Le Guin made some disparaging comments about Dick’s later work, specifically the treatment of women in VALIS […] Dick took Le Guin’s criticisms seriously, and in many ways Dick’s final novel, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer (1982) […] was written in response.’ At the risk of running dampening David Gill’s appraisal of Angel as a ‘deep, intelligent, and charming female first-person narrator’, I would propose a slightly bold hypothesis that, within the confines of my argument, she be seen as conforming to the otherwise male position of Dick’s ‘narrator/subjects’. \ 	To qualify this let’s look briefly at Angel’s unique position. Whilst she is the narrator of her novel, we may draw a clue from the very title: ‘The Transmigration of Timothy Archer’. Within the book, it is with him that Angel continually identifies: she draws a series of comparisons between herself and him, noting finally that ‘I am no different, then, from Timothy Archer’ (144-5); he is a constitutive presence, and she comes to the conclusion that ‘I defined myself—my identity—in terms of being Bishop Archer’s daughter-in-law and friend (114). Unlike the relationship of Phil/Fat with Gloria, his/their object of desire, and that of Herb Asher and Linda Fox, Angel’s relationship Timothy, her object of desire, is built upon a reversal of the dynamic within the two other books, as I’ve said above. In them, Gloria and Linda are the feminine objects that exist as extensions of the ‘subject\arrator’—the notorious Lacanian phrase ‘woman is […] a symptom of man’, however problematic we might find it elsewhere, would seem here to apply. As characters these women are necessarily constituted by their relationship with the ‘subject\arrator’ and their status as an object of desire. With Angel/Bishop Archer, this relationship is reversed: Angel constitutes herself as an object of Bishop Archer’s desire. \ 	Laura Mulvey discusses the ways in which within classic cinema, ‘the story places the reader, listener or spectator with the [male] hero’, and that ‘the woman spectator in the cinema can make use of an age-old cultural tradition adapting her to this convention, which eases a transition out of her sex into another’. I argue that this is what is occurring in Transmigration. However strong a character Angel might be elsewhere, she is guided through an identification with a male hero and thus conforms to the hierarchy of repetition that I have identified in chapter two. Her story revolves around him. \ Returning once more to the ‘ill woman’, we may see how finally their deaths are what ensures coherence for the ‘narrator/subject’ in the face of the ‘dissolution of the subject’ that Durham talks about. A brief look at these should elucidate my point. In VALIS, Sherri succumbs to her cancer remission. This comes after she has moved out of Phil/Fat’s apartment and that, as a result, ‘the argument can be made that at this point Fat no longer had any moral obligation to Sherri’ (107). However, despite this, he had still loved her during her illness and ‘every day he visited her in hospital’ (108). Her death is what vindicates his later actions: ‘as I had forseen, Fat had two deaths on his conscience’ (142), Phil says. The subsequent events of the novel, Fat’s ‘sacred quest’ (140) is actually a disguised attempt by him to go out ‘searching for two dead girls: Gloria and Sherri’. In this instance, it is the death of this woman that is explicitly linked by Phil to Fat having ‘gone crazy’ (113), not his own division. \ In Invasion, the ‘ill woman’ Rybys suffers two deaths, though only one occurs within the text. In the first, she dies in the flycab collision that also sent Herb Asher into a coma. Emmanuel, the ‘divine child saviour’ that she carries in her womb, turning her, in her words, into a ‘diseased rat in a kind of cage’ (58), survives, and thus in death she delivers him from the star system CY30-CY30B to Earth, fulfilling some sort of higher purpose. More interesting is her second ‘death’, which occurs after she is resurrected within ‘The Secret Commonwealth’. No longer a Virgin Mary character, Herb says that ‘she is ill for illness’s sake, for its own sake’ (225), and that as a result he is ‘going to escape from this, finally’. From that point on something rather noteworthy happens: she simply disappears from the text; Herb is united with Linda Fox, and Rybys is forgotten, left ‘sleep[ing], dreaming of malignancy’ (227). In this second case, she is not even afforded the dignity of a physical death; instead, her removal from the narrative is a necessary effect of Asher’s acquisition of the Fox and (apparent) freedom from the chain of repetition automatism. \ Kirsten in Transmigration commits suicide, unable to face the ordeal of cancer treatment. This leads to two mutually exclusive yet equally prevalent consequences within the text. First, Angel considers her act: ‘What malice. What abysmal cruelty, toward us all. She really hated us. This is our punishment’ (176). We learn that Angel’s ‘mind had begun to go, due to Kirsten’s suicide’ (192); she views it as a purposeful, calculated attack on both herself and Timothy Archer. However, as a result of Kirsten’s death, Angel gains new ambition within her career, and ‘within a year, […] had risen to the post of manager of the Musik Shop’ (194). Timothy Archer himself also stops ‘catering to astrology. Casting horoscopes’ (180); spiritualist beliefs that cost him his position as bishop of the church. Thus, her death is both simultaneously an attack on them both, as well as a blessing, from which they derive benefit. \ To bring my argument full-circle, let us finally reconsider that voice of the super-ego, for it is this voice, ‘that affects one at the most intimate level, but which one cannot master and over which one has no power or control’ that may explain this difficult constitution of sexual difference. For, given that this voice plays such a central role to the narration of these books, and its mark is that of ‘ineradicable guilt’ that one cannot hope to satisfy, we may understand why it is that these ‘ill women’ are assigned the status’ of pariahs within the texts. The compulsion that otherwise marks the ‘repetition automatism’ of these texts supports this further: this ‘impulse is sustained by a cruel superego imperative’, and, sadly, it seems that within Dick’s texts, the answer that resolves this impossible chain is an extremely problematic constitution of sexual difference. \ Conclusion \ 6. The Empire never ended. \ At the start of my inquiry, I set out to explore the subjects of Dick’s late work, and how their division presents the reader with a difficult narrative position which, from all sides, appears to be assailed by ‘the deceptions of madness’ which ‘abound and mask themselves as their mirror opposite: […] sanity’ (VALIS, 81). I have demonstrated how these subjects are comprised of a fundamental division, how Dick’s choice of splitting his narrator in VALIS points to a far more fundamental rupture at their core: that of castration. Going further, I have shown how this damaged centre has left scars across all three books in the form of a repetition automatism that constitutes a symbolic chain of events in which the subjects appear to be trapped. Finally, I have shown how the solution to this problem within Dick’s late work is the constitution of a questionable sexual distance, one that sacrifices the figure of the ‘ill woman’ in each of his texts in order to allow his ‘narrator/subject’ a chance at attaining their ‘object of desire’ and ensure their own identity, something which, regardless, is never completely satisfied. \ 	It is undoubtedly true that the events that surrounded these texts’ composition were difficult, though the full purpose to the author of tackling such a difficult narrative subject may ultimately only be known by him. Certainly, Dick’s own explanations varied from the religiously jubilatory, claiming that he was attempting to ‘show that intervention [Christ] and the redeemed state’ of post-lapsarian man, to the much more simple idea of using the books as ‘a means to get the tractate’, the set of fifty three religious statements Dick includes at the end of VALIS, ‘published’ in mass circulation. I hope however that I have successfully demonstrated that there also exists at the heart of the ‘VALIS Trilogy’ a far more secular project of a subject caught in self-conflict and unresolvable position. \ 	Dick’s solutions to this problem may be problematic, but the texts in which they are worked out are nothing if not complicated. Christopher Palmer notes that the experience is one that is a ‘reminder that meaning has an ethical dimension’, and which explores ‘how painful it can be when the pursuit of the ethical collides with the proliferating textuality of meaning. We may take some comfort in the ending of the trilogy, which was to be the final book Dick wrote before dying of a stroke, seems to find some true resolution to breaking free of the symbolic repetition that otherwise marks the books. It is a moment that mirrors the end of A Scanner Darkly, in which Donna Hawthorn is left waiting on the ‘outside’ of the New Path rehab facility, for the destroyed Bob Arctor, and she resolves to him that, one day, ‘you’ll see the way you saw before’. At the end of Transmigration, Angel is likewise left waiting on the ‘outside’ of a mental institution for her friend the schizophrenic Bill, and she says ‘I am going to fight to make you okay again, […] I will see you as you were; I will not give up. You will remember the ground again. […] I will wait for you Bill Lundborg’ (Transmigration, 245), a conclusion that suggests a possible alternate means of escaping from the repetition automatism of desire than through the death of the ‘ill woman’. \ ‘The impact of trauma makes the processes of remembering and forgetting more complex than in other situations, and survivors are therefore particularly likely to express themselves in stories containing elements which are imaginary, fragmented or disjointed, and loaded with symbolism’; it is my contention that in ‘Naming the Names’ Anne Devlin examines how the violence of The Troubles has affected discourse, and the demands of telling narrative, for her narrator Finn and the wider community around her. \ A story of two distinct halves, told retroactively in the guise of a confession or recounting, the reader’s understanding of the plot revolves around a crux midway through which prompts an immediate revision of the events leading up to this point. To begin with, the story appears to be a ‘formulaic love-across-the-barricades romance’;  even lines that hint towards the conclusion, such as Finn exclaiming that ‘I thought if he even touched me I’d tell him – Oh run! Run for your life from me!’,  referring to the (soon to be) murdered judge’s son, appear to be a part of the melodrama of this simple love story rather than anything more sinister. The gradual re-framing of the narrative that occurs as Finn reveals more of the motivations behind her actions is mediated by the knowledge that her story is an extremely controlled one, and that we as the readers are only allowed to see what she wants us to. As such, the scenes depicted may be safely assumed to have been selected for their latent meaning, knowing that within the short story form especially ‘it takes every word […] to say what the meaning is’.  \ 	Viewing one of these, in the home of her grandmother where she lives, Finn offers us a profound insight into her own psychology. The dusty interior of the grandmother’s house, decorated ‘as if an old lady still lived [there]’ (109), is transformed by the later revelation of the firebombing that occurred on its street from being a slightly dated living-room into one that is both the physical location of community violence and represents the subsequent inability for any kind of ‘moving on’ from this experience. The lack of any updating of the furniture or of even cleaning the room keeps Finn residing literally within the space of the woman who brought her up, and figuratively within the time and site of the traumatic episode. Graham Dawson talks about this connection between an internal ‘site of trauma’, and the location in which it was sustained, by saying that they are formed ‘within the internal landscape that are derived from, and remain imaginatively linked to, the material sites of violence within social environments’. As such, the disrepair of Finn’s living space, rather than simply meaning that she needs to ‘open the curtains!’ (109), reflects her state of ‘feeling ‘stuck’ and unable to ‘move on’ psychically’ from the violence she suffered, an experience commonly experienced by those involved in The Troubles. \ 	Ironically then, Finn’s eventual incarceration actually represents the beginnings of her freedom from the internment of her past. Her confession to the police, and to the reader, reflects in some small way the account given by Dori Laub of his ‘witnessing’ the testimony given to him by Holocaust survivors in interview. He speaks of this process as the breaking of an imposed ‘silence’, and I feel this is a silence also found within Devlin’s story. \ Finn’s relationships with those around her are distant and, like her relationship with the reader, tightly controlled.  She articulates an unease about Mrs O’Hare’s motivations when she says that ‘I was very careful to say as little as possible in front of her’ (106), a statement that is also true of the other people in her life; silence, and the specifically unsaid words, are what dominate her interactions. Taking Jack as an example, the juxtaposition of Finn’s otherwise unexplained outbursts—‘throw[ing] milk all over him’ (108) and ‘smash[ing] all the dinner dishes’—with the admission that ‘somehow I never talked to him about anything important’ belies the great emotional tumult residing within these unarticulated spaces. \ 	This is also true of discourse elsewhere. When discussing recent violence, the language used by Mrs O’Hare, Finn and Chrissie is punctuated by euphemistic shorthand and other forms of stop-gap. Talking about ‘the bomb’ (107), Mrs O’Hare cuts herself short when elaborating on the details by breaking immediately into gossip: ‘She doesn’t want any more staff crossing the peace line at night. Not after that young – but wait till you hear – he won’t go!’ All parties presumably know what happened to that ‘young –‘, but for the reader it remains an unuttered detail. However, its unutterability grants it a presence more forcefully than the fact: in refusing to name the violence, and to discuss it openly, ‘the events become more and more distorted in their silent retention and perversely invade and contaminate the survivor’s daily life’. In avoiding the possibility of speaking violence, the women speak nothing but the violence; the turns of their conversation are mediated entirely by the intention to keep it repressed. \ This contamination of daily life manifested throughout the story, with violence underpinning even innocent discourse early on. The small girl Sharleen’s request for books—‘I want three murders for my granny’ (103)—and Chrissie’s later comment on one she’s picked out—‘this is just too, too grisly, […] do they always have to be murders? Would you not like a nice love story?’ (105)—are elevated by this knowledge upon second reading to become both a foreshadowing of the story’s later twist and the posing of a meta-textual question by Devlin herself: why is it that her story has to have the violent turn? \ 	The answer to this question provides what might be considered Devlin’s commentary on the response to the violence enacted by those Belfast communities that she depicts. The lack of a meaningful discussion of pain in Finn’s life, and her subsequent difficulty in framing her experiences within a conventional narrative may point toward the absence of what Dawson calls a ‘cultural […] ‘listening space’, where the language of trauma may be spoken, attended to, reflected on and absorbed’, the presence of which is necessary for allowing the traumatised subject to engage with their experience and recover from it. As such, Devlin’s story highlights a perceived failing within Belfast’s ‘survivor’ communities to provide their inhabitants with the support necessary for any significant moving on. The ‘stumps like tombstones’ (114) that Finn says have replaced the buildings on the Falls Road demonstrate this most forcefully: for her even the buildings themselves are unable to be more than monuments to the violence that has occurred. \ In each of these stories, music plays a central role to the narrative. It is my contention that the effect of the music is not simply limited to the mise en scène or, in the case of Music at Annahullion, to the form of a prop around which a narrative might be constructed. Instead it is I argue linked fundamentally to the hope of ambition within the characters and, going further, is used by the authors to embody the frustration and tragic failure of these ambitions to be realised. As I will demonstrate, music and dancing are used as a method of exploring questions of masculinity, expression in the face of difficult circumstances, and escapism from responsibility. Their use highlights in non-verbal ways how characters control and damage one another, and the consequences that these power-struggles have on others around them. Finally, I will also look at silence in these works; at those instances when music and articulation fails. The theme of failure is prevalent throughout these texts, and its primacy is held within plot as well as methods of narration. \ 	All three stories present non-traditional depictions of masculinity; indeed they all ask serious questions about what it is to be a man, and their characters are likewise caught in this trap of uncertainty. Gerry Evans, the father of the narrator, Michael, in Dancing at Lughnasa, expresses this eloquently when he tries to explain why he is going off to fight in the Spanish Civil War: ‘there’s bound to be something right about the cause, isn’t there? And it’s somewhere to go – isn’t it? Maybe that’s the important thing for a man: a named destination – democracy, Ballybeg, heaven.’ We see here that at the heart of this character is a fundamental uncertainty, an unanswered longing that seems to dictate his actions. In the question marks that end his sentences, in his use of the words ‘something’ and ‘maybe’, Gerry poses the possibility that masculinity is something that can only be imitated, can only be attempted or performed, rather than it being something one can necessarily grasp on to and claim for one’s self. It isn’t something certain or concrete. His conclusion that it is the act of ‘naming’ that designates what is ‘the important thing for a man’ demonstrates its frailty; ‘the arbitrary nature of the sign’. I argue that here Friel’s play highlights the broad sweep of Saussure’s basic tenant of semiology: that meaning is a thing constructed rather than innate, that Gerry’s uncertainty highlights a fundamental lack underlying assumptions of masculinity. \ His life of drifting can be seen as one in which he attempts to grasp this idea of manhood, through trying out the many different roles in which we find him: father, teacher, lover, soldier, self-employed salesman, (as it turns out) family man, etc. None of these seem to satisfy him however; we learn that despite the war nothing changes for Gerry, he still visits only occasionally and ‘each time he was on the brink of a new career’ (61), ‘each time he proposed to [Michael’s] Mother and promised [him] a new bike’. Gerry is a figure of unfulfilled promises, and as such he never finds any stability or masculine certainty that would mark an acceptance of his responsibilities and an improvement of the lives of the other characters. \ 	Tied in with this uncertain and destabilised image of masculinity is the music that permeates the play via the wireless set, Marconi. Michael himself confirms at the start of the play that, for whatever reason, the wireless set and his memories of Father Jack’s return—which, in itself, is also the instance of another failed patriarch—‘are  always linked’ (2). The fact that Marconi is the first mentioned ‘character’ of the play is very telling; here also, like Gerry, is a narrative element whose chronic failure is central to the play’s plot and orientates the world of the inhabitants of the house. For Gerry, it seems that it’s only through dancing to the music from the wireless, real or imagined, that he ever manages to get close to some sort of romantic ideal to which he seems attached, and through which he remains (at least superficially) oblivious to the consequences that his restless lifestyle has on the sisters and his young son. We see how this dancing is actively tied up to this fantasy when, near the start of act two, he enters and begins an exchange with Chris: \ GERRY: No false modesty. You know you’re a great dancer, Chrissie. \ CHRIS: No, I’m not. \ GERRY: You should be a professional dancer. \ CHRIS: You’re talking rubbish. \ GERRY: Let’s dance around the garden again. \ CHRIS: We’ve done that; and down the lane and up again – without music. And that’s enough for one day. \ (50) \ His entire interaction with her, and with the other sisters, is in this way largely superficial and frivolous; all he wants to do is dance. Indeed, it is only through the other women in the house narrating the action off-centre in a manner akin to a Greek chorus that we learn that ‘we probably won’t see Mr Evans for another year – until the humour suddenly takes him again’ (34), and that ‘that’s what a creature like Mr Evans does: appears out of nowhere and suddenly poisons the atmosphere in the whole house’. \ 	Richard Pine says that in Lughnasa, Friel ‘employs the metaphorical dance as a means of bringing onto the stage emotions that cannot be expressed in words – elemental, chthonic, madness and gaiety, a hovering […] above the mundane and its vocabulary’. In this light, we may see Gerry’s incessant urge to dance as a means of putting-off having to say those things that Kate expresses, of keeping at arm’s length the truth of his actions whilst allowing his own expression through his dancing. This may be why, when injured in the war, it is because his limp ‘put an end to his dancing days’ (61) that it ‘really distressed him’. If we return to his speech regarding his reasons for going to war, we see that he acknowledges the impossibility of masculine actualisation that such an endeavour carries before he even sets off. The irony is that in pursuing that ‘named destination’, Gerry inadvertently loses that one means of expression to which he has a claim; the ability to dance. He is left less of a ‘man’ than when he set out. \ We can see, that within Lughnasa, dancing for Gerry serves two purposes: in one regard it is a means of expression, of his way of attempting to expel some of the emotion that he must know his actions cause, but that he is unable to acknowledge; in the other, it serves as a means of silencing those emotions, of denying them the possibility of vocal articulation. Kate’s theory about the wireless – ‘D’you know what that thing has done? Killed all Christian conversation in this country’ (66) – here rings true. Music and the dance both offer an avenue of expression and prevent the full ‘working through’ of that movement. \ 	In The Mai, music is also very much linked to the figure of an absent father, a dreamer who gives serious weight to his own (literal and figurative) dreams: Robert. He uses his dreams as a means to talk to The Mai when he says that ‘not everything has to be final and tragic, Mai, not everything. And dreaming about death always means something else. Dreams aren’t that vulgar, they’re coy, elusive things. They have to be, the amount of times I’ve dreamt about you dying, and here you are healthy as a trout’. It is a dream that sends him back ‘home’ to her, and it is clear that, like Gerry in Lughnasa, Robert is attempting to enact some sort of romantic fantasy with this return, one that ignores the real impact of his actions upon the family, and that ultimately fails to live up to his expectations because of this. \ 	After they return from The Lion’s Ball, the Mai mocks Robert’s outlook: \ ROBERT: I’ve told you a thousand times, my private life is my own business. \ THE MAI: Your private life! I am your private life! You invent these ridiculous compartments! You’ll never be a great composer with – \ ROBERT: The last thing I need at this hour is a lecture from – \ THE MAI: You’ll never be a great composer with such crude and vulgar compartments! \ ROBERT: I’m going to bed! \ THE MAI: That’s right. Pretend none of this is happening. Go on to bed and dream of that ignorant fucking bitch! \ (64) \ It seems that, even in the passion of a heated exchange, The Mai picks up on Robert’s liability to flee back to his ‘dreams’ rather than facing reality. As Maria Doyle notes, ‘part of Robert’s particular failure is his tendency to remove himself from the household at crucial moments’, but I would argue that in reality, Robert never fully commits himself to his position within the household in the first place. As she says: ‘in this play, men feature primarily as absences’. It is this presence through absence that marks the men within both of these plays; like the wireless Marconi, they make themselves most known through their mis-functioning, through the silences that abruptly interrupt the behaviour that is expected of them. \ 	In this exchange between Robert and The Mai, we also have that other element of his character; that of his identity as a composer. For Robert, this apparent fantasy of himself as some grand musical artist is inseparable from that of his sexual and family life; we should note here that in the very first interaction we see between him and The Mai, he ‘taps her shoulder, hip bone, ankle’ with his bow, before ‘he plays the cello bow across her breasts’ (11). The Mai for Robert appears here to simply be an extension of his cello, and he views his relationship with her in the same light, with himself as the master, the ‘player’, and her as the ‘played upon’. That she might have a life, an agency of her own doesn’t seem to factor into his world-view, and this is something that she plays upon later when she takes the bow, sits at his cello and ‘plays a few phrases expertly’ (48) herself. Just before doing this, she sarcastically parodies his dreams of romance by offering him fruit and saying: ‘here, let me feed you. Isn’t that what lovers do?’ Following this, their argument exposes the total dissonance between their two different world-views and the realities of their relationship. His first port-of-call for an alternative present to the one he gave her for her fortieth birthday is to ‘take [her] to Spiddal and pretend everything is wonderful’, whereas the reality of her birthday is far more mundane: ‘I collected the children from their schools, I did twelve loads of laundry, I prepared eight meals, I dropped the children back to their schools, and I read Plato and Aristotle on education, because education is my business’. \ 	This exchange makes it starkly clear, as does the play elsewhere, that The Mai is anything but an inert object within Robert’s romantic schema. The ease with which she plays his cello, and ‘stops to snap a [bow] string as it suits her’ (49) demonstrates just how much power she has in the relationship. That her suicide is the ultimate end to this story however demonstrates the toll that it takes upon her. \ This leads me on to the third text I’m examining: Music at Annahullion. Here, music plays a markedly different role to that within the two plays; however, like them, it is I argue still linked intimately with the ideas of dreams, aspirations, and desires for the characters of the story. The music here is of course totally absent from the story; it exists as pure potentiality, as an unarticulated possibility. The very lack of music in the story, that silence that fills the space it should be, is the property that lends it its pertinence. \ 	The story is set in ‘a ‘Land Poisoned’’; one whose degradation reflects the lives of the characters, totally devoid of meaning or pertinence. The piano likewise is in poor order, however, unlike everything else, it’s ‘aisy fixed’ (96). The implication is that, as the piano can be fixed no matter how many things are wrong with it, likewise their lives and the land they live upon can be fixed too. However, this is not to be the case. The house, the thing that both shelters and imprisons them is ‘made to last’ (90), and when it comes down to a standoff between the piano and the house, the symbols of a rotten past and a hopeful future, it is of course the house that ultimately wins over. This fate is acknowledged and foreshadowed in the opening of the piano itself: the newspaper advertisement that’s held inside its body, reading out boldly ‘WHAT LIES AHEAD FOR YOU’ (98), tells both us the readers and the characters of the story that they cannot hope for any more than ‘the weight of forty years’ of hardship that has preceded them. This is why the piano, left to rot in the turf shed, haunts Annie so and gives her ‘strange dreams that made her unhappy’ (100). All the while it exists unused it gives form to all of Annie’s frustrations and disappointments, and pulls attention to the absence of the music that might have been. \ 	We might turn to Roland Barthes to provide a theoretical framework regarding the music in these three works. In his essay ‘Musica Practica’, he designates a separation between two different ‘musics’: ‘the music one listens to, the music one plays.’ This separation draws attention to a certain characteristic of that second kind of music, that music as it is experienced by an active performer rather than a passive listener: \ It is the music which you or I can play […] a muscular music in which the part taken by the sense of hearing is one only of ratification, as though the body were hearing – and not ‘the soul’; […] the body controls, conducts, co-ordinates, having itself to transcribe what it reads, making sound and meaning, the body as inscriber and not just transmitter, simple receiver. \ We see here that Barthes identifies in this type of music an innate agency that transforms the body into a subject of power, one with the ability to create and control meaning. \ 	This goes some way to identifying a reason for the power that music and performance has within these texts. It would not be going too far to describe them all as texts whose landscapes appear to trap the characters inside them and remove any hope of escape. The theme of character’s futures being bound to their past, and of inter-generational fatalism, is strong in all three: The Mai and Robert’s children all ‘teeter along the fringe of the world with halting gait, reeking of Owl Lake at every turn’ (70); the remaining sisters at the end of Lughnasa are trapped in the domestic tasks of the house and the knitting factory for the rest of their lives, and Michael admits that ‘when my time came to go away, in the selfish way of young men I was happy to escape’ (71); the advertisement in Annahullion that I have already mentioned also asks the question ‘Why not make the future certain?’ (98), which, it seems, the destruction of the piano does, and this is something that is also confirmed by Liam’s final remark about his brother Teddy as having ‘no wit, that man’ (101), and that he ‘always bought foolish. His uncle Eddie was identical’. Music in these texts seems to provide some sort of hope of escape, some way for the characters to become ‘inscribers’ of their fate rather than simply passive figures who are inscribed upon. \ 	The tragedy of these texts of course is that, in all three, the music fails to deliver upon this possibility. In none of them are the characters able to escape their situations through this liberatory power of music; instead, like the wireless set Marconi, the music ultimately splutters, before falling silent. What this failure does draw our attention to is the consequences that the actions of those attempting to escape has upon those around them. In both plays, the sisters and children are made to suffer because of the father-figures. Because they do not face the reality of their situations, and instead attempt to escape via music, via dancing, they force the other characters all the more firmly into the painful certainty of their plight. This fact allows us to pose a question regarding Annahullion: do Annie’s actions ultimately make her and her brothers’ situation worse for their failure? Her dream would certainly seem to suggest so: ‘She felt her heart was breaking, she wanted to pray but all she could do was cry. ‘What are you cryin’ for, Annie?’ Teddy was standing in the parlour door. ‘Everything…all of us…I wish to God we were never born’ (100). \ The texts in this way ultimately maintain an uneasy ambivalence towards the place of music within them; simultaneously acknowledging its emancipatory capacity whilst refusing to subscribe fully to it as a means of escape. This unresolved tension may be one of the greater elements that contributes to the emotional power of all three stories. \ In this essay I will be examining Anton Chekhov’s short story ‘Ward Number Six’, and the ontological status of madness within it. As a text which seriously questions the divide between madness and sanity, Chekhov’s work serves to expose how flimsy the underlying assumptions are regarding the solidity of these categories, as well as the Kafkaesque levels of bureaucratic medical practice that regulate those people deemed insane, an aspect of his work that has been noticed elsewhere. In my approach, I aim to use the first chapter of Shoshana Felman’s book Writing and Madness, in which she tackles the academic debate that surrounded Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Foucault’s book Folie et déraison, to provide a theoretical framework for approaching the question of madness. Specifically, I will be using the intersection of Derrida, Foucault, and Felman’s work in order to explore the literary quality of madness, and to ask whether using a literary conception of it, as Chekhov does, provides us with a greater understanding of it than a purely medical one would. This question is also ultimately a political one, as the work of Foucault demonstrates, and it has broad implications regarding one’s faculties of articulation and autonomy. I hope that in my analysis I will be able to demonstrate some of the reasons why Chekhov’s text allows a nuanced theory of madness, one that sees the possibility of its occurrence in us all. \ 	One of the primary aims of Felman’s book is to demonstrate the centrality of language to experiences of madness. She quotes Freud as having said that the act of repression is in itself a ‘failure of translation’, and she aims to expose these repressive acts within texts and language itself when dealing with madness: ‘the question ”How does a text talk about madness?” is incomplete without the concomitant question: How, within the text itself, is madness denied? How does it confront what blocks it?’ She goes on to describe how Foucault conceives madness as being a ‘problem of elocution’ (42), in that one cannot ultimately articulate madness fully within language. This great disjunction between the seemingly rational system of language and the irrational departure of madness from it is what forms the basis of Derrida’s criticism of his project. ‘Any translation of madness is already a form of its repression, a form of violence against it’ (43) Felman tells us, and so in Foucault’s work ‘not only […] does madness remain necessarily confined in the fortress which holds it prisoner, but Foucault’s own enterprise is itself imprisoned by the conceptual economy it claims to denounce’. Folie et Déraison, Derrida claims, participates in the very system of historical violence against the mad that it aims to describe. \ 	That language is so tied up with this history of subjugation necessarily raises questions over how we might articulate that which cannot be expressed; how to give voice to the impossible. ‘The silence of madness’ (47) that Derrida highlights may, Felman argues, be expressed in fiction and literature. Because both Derrida and Foucault ‘agree on the existence of a literary buffer zone between madness and thought’ (48), Felman says that that is here we might find some answers to that question of expression. It is not simply to the content of fictional works that we should turn however; it is something that resides in the unarticulated pathos of fiction which constitutes its epistemological power as a means of understanding human experience. She says that ‘if, excluded from philosophy, madness is indeed to some extent contained in literature, it by no means constitutes its content’ (50). Madness necessarily exceeds that which attempts to contain it, however it is in the implicit pathos of literature that we might locate madness and attempt to formulate some sort of understanding of it. \ 	Allow me to now turn to Chekhov’s work and examine the depiction of madness within it. The two characters around whom the question of ‘genius or madman’ revolves and who I will be examining are Dr. Ragin and Ivan Gromov. Each seemingly a double of the other, of the kind that Radislav Lapushin says problematizes ‘the borders between human individuals in Chekhov’s prose’, the relationship they strike up mid-way through the story serves to subvert the roles in which they are established at the start. Ivan, originally simply a mad inmate, is elevated to the status of philosophical genius through the insights he provides to Ragin; Ragin himself, through his association with this patient and the shunning of his colleagues and friends, is reduced from being a respected doctor to becoming seen as a madman himself. Their reversal is one of a number of devices that Chekhov uses in order to show that ‘each of us has the plague within him’; that we are all capable of adopting madness, of being perceived as such by our peers and falling victim to the consequences that follow. As Gromov says himself, is it ‘so difficult to commit a crime accidentally and against one’s will? Can false accusations—can judicial miscarriages, for that matter—really be ruled out?’ \ 	This association of hospitalisation with both accusation and incarceration begins in the very first paragraph of the text, in which the narrator notes that all aspects of the outside of the hospital ‘have the melancholy, doomed air peculiar to hospital and prison buildings’ (23). It then continues in this vein with Gromov’s introduction. It is following his sight of some prisoners in a back-alley that ‘it suddenly dawned on him that he himself might be clapped in irons and similarly hauled off to prison through the mud’, a fate that of course, in the manner of a self-serving prophecy, is fulfilled (27). This is taken to its logical conclusion with the end of the story, where attempting to leave Ward Number Six and buck this rigid hierarchy costs Ragin his life, though it does give him sudden insight into ‘the daily lot, year in year out, of these men [the other inmates] who loomed before him like black shadows in the moonlight’ (68). The redemptive value of Ragin’s death also solidifies for us the brutality of the institutional violence that occurs within Ward Number Six, and as such Chekhov forces his readers to confront the relationship between violent incarceration and mental health in a similar manner to that of Foucault. \ 	We should ask the question: does Chekhov’s text present this incarceration as necessary, or absurd? The answer falls decidedly upon the latter. Nikita, the embodiment of the disciplinary arm of The Law, is ‘one of those dull, self-assured, punctilious simpletons who believe in discipline above all things and who are therefore convinced that people need hitting’ (23). The humour here acts against the pain caused by this disciplinary violence; rather than make light of it, Chekhov attempts to show that the sort of person Nikita embodies ‘is degrading himself with his blows, not the person he’s hitting’ (49), despite the criticism of such an apparently laissez faire philosophy that also appears in his text. These blows also sadly demonstrate that, like madness, violence it seems is another unifying force that, in its ubiquity and arbitrariness, erases boundaries between persons. This is epitomised most fully in Gromov’s ‘right-hand neighbour’ (30), the ‘bloated, nearly globular peasant with an obtuse, utterly witless expression’. Here, we have a character so used to receiving violence, so completely broken by its uninterrupted application, that he does not ‘respond to blows with any sound, movement or expression of the eyes’; instead he simply ‘rocks gently, like a heavy barrel’. \ 	Even the narrator does not attempt to hide their disgust at what has become of this peasant, calling him an ‘inert, gluttonous animal with dirty habits’. Any trace of his identity, even his gender and basic human dignity has been removed from him. The narrator’s scorn would seem to mask a more primal horror: that such a fate is possible for those under the supposed care of psychiatric institutions. We might infer, as does John Stone, that such figures were only too commonplace on the island of Sakhalin, where Chekhov spent three months at an odious penal colony and gathered much material there to be used in his work. Stone notes that ‘if Chekhov needed models for Nikita, […] he found plenty on Sakhalin’, and we might note from this the serious agenda that underlies this story. Chekhov does not simply mean to fictionalise these stories of madness, or transform their experience into a form of entertainment. He is instead making ‘a plea for effective and humane psychiatric care’. This humanitarian goal is something that drives the poignancy of this story and lends to it its emotional power. \ Let us turn now to his actual depiction of madness. In Gromov in particular, Chekhov confronts the mechanism of madness directly, and attempts to give an insight for the reader into its workings. The passage in which his paranoia begins, and grows, shows us how for Gromov one of the first major signs of his illness is the cessation of his reading. Up until this point, reading is something that Ivan has done ‘a great deal’ (27), but as his paranoia progresses, and he begins spending more and more time dreaming up ways he might be apprehended, he no longer does it. We are told that he becomes secluded and avoidant, that ‘he daily concocted thousands of miscellaneous pretexts for serious apprehension about his freedom and honour’ (29), and that ‘with this went a considerable weakening of interest in the external world, especially in books’. Up until this point being ‘well read’ (27) formed a primary part of his charm about town, and one of the major reasons the narrator gives us for his being so well liked is that he was considered ‘a sort of walking encyclopaedia’. Gromov’s madness appears to end this. Not only does he no longer read, but his speech is replaced by an ‘insane babble’ (25), which is ‘jumbled, feverish, delirious, jerky, not always comprehensible’, despite having ‘a fine ring about it’ which suggests intelligence beneath its exterior. Language itself seems to fail him. \ 	Stone interprets one section of the narrator’s description, in which we are told of Gromov standing ‘in the middle of [his] room until dawn, perfectly still, his ears cocked’ (29) as being suggestive that Gromov has begun to hear voices. He argues that ‘Chekhov, the writer, has raised the spectre of auditory hallucinations for the reader without having to spell it out in language that Chekhov, the physician, would use’. What we find here in Stone’s reading is the implication of an unarticulated symptom within Chekhov’s text. Gromov’s experience is not only un-writeable it seems, ‘hard to convey […] on paper’ (25); it quite literally exists inside of a dimension beyond strict rationality. \ 	What Chekhov is doing here is attempting to convey through his text exactly that which he cannot by definition set down on paper. This is in effect an enacting of what ‘Derrida asserts’ (Felman, 52): that ‘madness can only be made present “metaphorically”’ through the ‘pathos’ of the book. This tension between the explicit textual description of Gromov’s descent and the metaphor used to evoke it lies at the heart of the text’s power to carry across the ‘truth’ of these delusions. Take for example the following juxtaposition: the description, ‘for nights on end he lay awake expecting to be arrested, but snoring aloud and sighing as if in slumber so that his landlady should think him asleep. If he couldn’t sleep he must be suffering the pangs of conscience, mustn’t he? Rather a give-away that!’ (Chekhov, 28), is placed immediately beside the metaphor that ‘he was like a certain hermit who wanted to hew himself a home in virgin forest, but the more forcefully he plied his axe the more densely and vigorously did the trees burgeon around him’ (29). Not satisfied with either narrative device by itself, it is in the very space that is opened between the literal description of Gromov’s thoughts and the metaphor that the narrator provides us with that Chekhov aims to convey the true feeling of this experience. It is an acting against what Foucault decries in ‘the modern world’s effort to speak of madness only in the serene, objective terms of mental illness and to obliterate its pathos’ (Foucault, p.182, quoted in Felman, p. 51). In resorting to the literary, alongside the medical, Chekhov here attempts to move beyond the ‘violence’ done against the experience of madness by the act of ‘translation’ and grant to it the dignity of the ‘pathetic resonance’ (Felman, 51) that this necessarily erases. It is not simply a matter of finding the sublime in suffering (think for a moment of the profoundly tranquil moment of the ‘herd of deer’ (Chekhov, 69) that dart past Ragin in the instant before his death); it is instead an acknowledgement that one cannot simply name a delusion as such, nor dispel it as ‘neurotic nonsense’ (28) as Gromov attempts. The force of this experience simply lies beyond the scope of the literal, and it is precisely for this reason that turning to the literary may provide some understanding of it. ‘Madness, which is not simply mental illness, not an object, is nothing other than the excess of its pathos’ (Felman, 52), and it is this excess that constitutes Gromov for us. \ 	Given the ambitious scope of Chekhov’s depiction of Gromov’s descent into madness, what should we make of his attempt to do the same with Ragin, and his reversal of their ‘positions’ within the text? Ragin’s ‘descent’ is markedly different to that of Gromov’s, yet it occurs with the same apparent arbitrariness and utter desolation of his public and private life. Sally Wolff notes that ‘the diagnosis of Gromov’s insanity, and later, Ragin’s, raises a question in the story about the nature of insanity and the medical measurement of it’, and that Ragin ‘does not see himself as insane, but rather as a victim […] of a medical system incapable of diagnosing and treating mental illness’. However, it is quite clear to us as readers, even from our position of a narrative perspective that is centred on Ragin’s mind, that his personal and public lives are both suffering. The disjoint between Ragin’s perception of his own mind and that of everyone around him raises the two prospects that 1), Ragin may himself be deluded to the full extent of his own decline, and 2) that this is itself constructed solely via his societal relations around him and thus has no bearing on the ‘actual’ state of his psyche. \ 	This latter option is favoured by Wolff when she says that ‘little external evidence exists that Ragin is insane’, and it is one that is certainly supported by the narrator in the text when they say that the assessment of Ragin’s health is carried out by the board ‘in a manner of examiners aware of their own incompetence’ (Chekhov, 53). However we must bear in mind the difference between the narration of Ragin and Gromov’s declines. In Gromov, it seems quite clear to us that he is deluded and a danger to himself; in Ragin there seems to be little the matter other than his antisocial behaviour. However, this is a narrative device, and what Chekhov here introduces is the fundamental uncertainty of delusion. We cannot know for certain just how ‘far gone’ Ragin actually is, and indeed his behaviour does show signs of the ‘cessation of interest in the outside world, loss of a capacity to love, inhibition of all activity, and a lowering of the self-regarding feelings’ that Freud described as being symptomatic of one in the grip of melancholia, or depression. Without going as far as to attempt to diagnose Ragin based on textual evidence, suffice it to say that Chekhov is very clear in the ambiguity he maintains in the text’s depiction and never allows us an easy interpretation either way. \ 	It is this uncertainty that returns me finally to Felman. For, in his recourse to literary technique to maintain the ‘essence’ of madness, Chekhov demonstrates clearly that, as Foucault attempted to show, ‘the term madness is itself pathos, not logos; literature, and not philosophy’ (Felman, 52). In sustaining this complex understanding of madness in his text, of it as something that is ultimately unknowable, that cannot be pinned down with any degree of certainty, Chekhov demonstrates that the concrete boundaries with which we attempt to define it, however useful we may find them for prompting treatment, are arbitrary in their construction. Because they do not necessarily conform to the condition they attempt to describe, ‘Ward Number Six’ shows that the excess that constitutes madness makes it necessary to ‘maintain a kind of relativity without recourse’ (Foucault, Preface, quoted in Felman, 42); a language that allows for this kind of unrestricted difficulty. The fluidity of its depiction shows how what we think of as a ‘departure’ from normality may in fact take place in any of us without our awareness. In this way, Chekhov shows that our ideas of madness are often poorly suited, and that it may in fact inhabit anyone of us just as freely as Camus’s plague. His use of literature as a means of conveying this idea allows him an argumentative power that is otherwise missing from medical discourse alone. \ I’ll be examining the two texts Narrative Medicine by the doctor and literary scholar Rita Charon, and the opening chapter of The Wounded Storyteller by the sociologist Arthur W. Frank. In both texts the writers attempt to tackle a perceived problem that is occurring in the wake of recent medical developments over the past few decades. This is, they argue, that as diagnostic technologies advance and the ability for doctors to treat conditions which were once fatal increases, the actual lived experience of the patient is erased and as such their agency over their own bodies is weakened. \ This is a process that has been mapped by Brian Hurwitz. He argues that as time has gone on the clinical encounter and its subsequent report has become ‘much more standardized and abstract than its [historical] predecessors, […] partly as a result of the growing importance attached to biochemical, pathological, and imagining investigations’. They have moved away from the patient’s own experiences of their illness and have instead shifted to a more mechanical view of the body, of the body as a set of physical processes rather than a subject. While Hurwitz demonstrates that this isn’t an entirely modern phenomenon, his argument supports Frank in his claim that within contemporary medical discourse, the patient must submit to a doctor’s will and as such ‘the physician becomes the spokesperson for the disease’. He views this in terms of a ‘narrative surrender’ for the patient; a relinquishing of their right to articulate their own story. \ Rita Charon argues that this is particularly true since the 1980s, where she says that the ‘marketplace intrusion’ into health care has led to a troubling commodification of its services. The examples she gives that have resulted from this change include things such as office hours being sped up, corruption and corporate greed becoming present within the health-related industries—something particularly true of the system in the US where she was writing from—and that the balance of equality within the country’s healthcare system is being seriously undermined by market interests being placed before patient welfare. \ In order to combat these perceived shortfalls within the healthcare system, both she and Frank turn to what is termed ‘narrative medicine’ as one possible solution, and which she defines as ‘medicine practiced with the narrative competence to recognise, absorb, interpret, and be moved by the stories of illness’ (vii). It is the ‘circulation’ of these stories, both ‘professional and lay’, that forms the basis of the innate structural link between narrative and medicine (Frank, 5). Frank views this as an intrinsic part of the process of illness, made up of all the rhetorical expectations we’ve internalised since childhood, from the descriptions given to us by relatives of their illnesses, to advertisements we see on television, to the actual doctor/patient encounter itself when a person’s symptoms must be ‘translated’ into medically appropriate terminology. He argues for a reclamation by patients of their ability to tell their stories of illness. This is necessary because, he says, while modern medicine may prolong and improve patient quality of life, and so to some extent facilitate their ability for experience, as a discourse it cannot fully contain the suffering that this might entail. \ This suffering experienced in the body is one that persists beyond a description of symptoms or a course of treatment. He says that ‘the ill body is certainly not mute—it speaks eloquently in pains and symptoms—but it is inarticulate’ (2). Because these experiences cannot be expressed satisfactorily in any other way, he says that it is our responsibility to ‘give voice to the body, so that the changed body can become once again familiar in these stories’. It is through this voicing that he argues we might reverse some of the alienation of self that occurs in the experience of modern medicine. He’s not calling for an end to the medicine itself, or necessarily for any major change in the way that it is administered. Instead, he looks to what he terms as ‘alternative narratives’ that leave the beneficiary effects of modern medicine in place but that also allow for experiences that go beyond it to be articulated. Such an example is that of the ‘Cambridge Women’s Community Health Center’ that he discusses at length (12). \ In Narrative Medicine Charon takes a slightly different approach. Speaking as a doctor, she attempts to put forward methods of reforming medical practice from within the health-care system and a method of practice that will help to promote greater empathy between doctors and patients, which will ultimately lead to greater standards of care. She gives voice to some of the frustrations that she and her colleagues have felt at the changing climate of the health-care system and how it has worked to limit their ability to adequately care for their patients. She says that as more and more of their time must be devoted to administrative tasks rather than core patient care, and as elements such as clinical goals are introduced that reduce patients to statistics, the doctors who know how best to care for the ‘acutely ill’ (viii) are being replaced by ‘Hospitalists’ who are strangers to patients. \ In order to best prevent and treat illness, she argues that a relationship must be built between doctor and patient that takes a long time to establish, and that this relationship must include a level of intimacy beyond that outlined in current practice guidelines. She gives an example of how this kind of relationship has greatly affected her own powers of treatment through the story of a patient of hers asking her to sign a dubious disability form. Through a workshop Charon was attending at the time, which proposed an exercise in narrative medicine, she found that the ‘writing exercise invested me in learning of her [the patient’s] true plight instead of blaming her or suspecting her of malingering’ (6). \ Throughout the chapter of Charon’s book, she argues that the skills of interpretation, of being able to both allow the patient to effectively articulate their experience and of being able to read the meaning behind their words and actions, are key to effective medical care. She says that since her first experience of the powers of narrative with the patient described, she has come to realise that these skills of reading are: \ Deployed not only in the encounter between an individual patient and doctor but throughout medical practice: teaching, doing research, understanding and diagnosing disease, reflecting on one’s life in medicine, interacting with professional colleagues, and fulfilling the public responsibilities of medicine. (6) \ In this way, the relationship of power in the clinical encounter will shift from that of a doctor dictating to the patient the cause of their symptoms and then prescribing a course of treatment to a much more balanced understanding between the two parties. She argues that it is through learning the skills of respecting the multiple perspectives that subjective patient experience brings, and by ‘recognising and paying heed to [this] multitude of contradictory sources of authority’ (8) that the greatest reforms to the current health-care system might be made. \ 	Frank’s appeal to a ‘postmodern’ understanding of medicine may be viewed in this light. Jean-François Lyotard wrote that postmodernity ‘would be that which, in the modern, puts forward the unpresentable in presentation itself; that which denies itself the solace of good forms, […] that which searches for new presentations, not in order to enjoy them but in order to impart a stronger sense of the unpresentable’. It is this idea of a destabilisation of experience, of conveying what cannot be conveyed, that Frank refers to when he says that ‘telling stories of illness is the attempt, instigated by the body’s disease, to give a voice to an experience that medicine cannot describe’ (18). The subversion of the traditional power structure of the doctor/patient relationship is an acknowledgement that illness itself is a force for destabilization that exceeds our attempts to categorise it through the discourse of medicine. Such a move is a continuation, rather than a rejection, of the evolution of practice as mapped by Hurwitz. His highlighting of the emergence of ‘growing desires to experiment anew with different forms of literalism in the writing of clinical case reports’ that ‘challenge the constraints imposed by traditional formats’ are indicative of these developments, and paint a hopeful picture for the future of the continuing understanding and experience of illness. \ In my essay I wish to look at the arguments made by various critics as to the ‘meaning’ of Utopia’s reformist aim, cross examine these, and pose the further question to them of asking what it means that More formulates his new society as being a part of the ‘New World’, beyond that of using it as a simple literary convention. In examining this question alongside the work of other Humanist writer Bartolemé Las Casas, I believe that there is more to Utopia’s physical location than simply that it is ‘far away’, and that in drawing comparison between More’s imagined Utopians and Las Casas’ depiction of the natives of the Indies, I might pursue my own argument that Utopia falls into a wider trend of Humanist thought that viewed the natives of the New World as ‘natural children’, rather than natural slaves. Beyond this, I believe that they also represented them as some sort of pre-Fall human beings of a ‘New Eden’, and that this depiction is one that erases both identity and implicitly paves the way for a conquest of perhaps even greater justification of that of the natural slave, as it is not simply ‘putting the land to better use’, but is in fact part of a Christian narrative of reclaiming land that rightly belongs to Europe. \ I believe, and I will attempt to demonstrate, that the debates that occurred at the time regarding the conquest of the newly ‘discovered’ Americas, and the legal status of the native inhabitants found there, have bearing upon the imaginative exercise that More puts forward in his book. As both were cast ‘in the language of humanist jurisprudence’, they are connected on a structural level as well as a thematic one, as Anthony Pagden lays out in his work on the subject. For, though in the Utopian society that More envisions slavery is enacted as a punishment for ‘heinous offenses’ committed by its citizens, rather than as a result of a certain caste of people being born as Aristotelian ‘natural slaves’, the ubiquity of slaves in Utopian society—performing all ‘vile service’, ‘laboursome toil and base business’ (65) in every dinner hall in the country, for example—demonstrates that the issue is there at the core of the text. \ The unique set of laws in Utopia regarding the abolition of private property also provide interesting resonances with the actual debates being held during the period in Spain. In the debates regarding the legitimacy of European ‘temporal authority over both Christians and pagans’ as a cause for conquest, these arguments came down to a question of property rights, or ‘dominum’; at no time were the peoples in question considered as people in their own right. This assumption of Christian dominance is also present within the texts, and by examining the way in which More depicts the Utopians’ acceptance of and adoption of Christian values at the end of his book, alongside Bartolomé de Las Casas’ impassioned arguments as to the similarly eager adoption of Christianity by the actual natives of the Americas, I hope to demonstrate how closely More’s writing was tied to a wider theory of subjugation. \ In order to examine More’s intentions regarding his book, and where it might be situated within the wider context of Renaissance Humanism, I turn first to Brendan Bradshaw’s essay on the topic. In it, he first summarises previous scholarship in the form of J. H. Hexter’s introduction to the Yale edition Utopia as follows: that More sought to illuminate the ‘inadequacy of the Christian humanist concept of reform and the soft-centred quality of its ideology’ by demonstrating that one would need to go further than simply changing the minds of the people in society in order to affect real radical change from the perceived ‘sterility and formalism’ of the late-Medieval church. To achieve this, Hexter argues, More calls for a ‘radical structural transformation’ of society, in the vein of the Utopian model that he puts forward. By emphasising their societal success ‘despite their lack of Christian rituals’, contrasted with the perceived failings of Europe even though it possessed the Christian sacraments, More highlighted the fundamental lack of the ‘real substance of Christianity’ within the contemporary Church and attempted to sketch out a new formulation of Christian society whose criteria would be ‘moral rather than institutional’. In doing so, Hexter sees More’s project as not simply imagining what society might be like ‘in a state of perfect nature’, but sets out to model a better society whilst taking into account human nature as it really is, and therefore, despite the apparent textual evidence to the contrary, Hexter claims that ‘Utopia is not a pagan idyll. It is a Christian ideal’ (my emphasis added). \ Placing Bradshaw’s further analysis to one side for a moment, I wish to briefly outline what he views as an important inversion of Hexter’s central thesis by G. R. Elton, and then begin my enquiry proper by looking at these alongside Utopia and the writing of Las Casas. Bradshaw points to Elton’s primary departure from Hexter as being in his conclusions about More’s ultimate motive in his writing: while Hexter maintains the optimistic view that he is attempting to steer Christian Humanism toward a real and achievable reform of society, Elton views the ‘Nowhere’ of Utopia’s literal meaning as being itself a literal end-point for the humanists’ project. By this, he means that the ‘humanist strategy was based upon an illusion’, and that, as admirable as their aims might be, the naïve assumptions they make regarding the capacity of ‘secular politics’ to incorporate the ‘single-minded altruism’ that would be required to affect the necessary changes renders their arguments nothing more than pipe-dreams. \ From all this, I hope it’s clear that More’s writing was heavily engaged with the thought of his contemporaries. More was not writing in a vacuum, and so by deciding to have his community situated in the New World, I argue, the implicit assumptions within the text correspond to other, similar assumptions made elsewhere regarding the real inhabitants of the Americas as a part of the justification of the colonial project. Given the amount of ‘playful juxtaposition of the real with the imaginary’ that occurs within text, it could be argued that his locale, whilst nodding to recent developments in Western exploration, simply takes advantage of a new and unknown territory to make his ‘remote island’ seem all the more plausibly distant from England. However, while the relationship between real and imaginary is obviously not a simple one, I believe there are instances in the text of real-world Amerindian ‘traits’ that denote a more-than-casual correspondence. The first of these I draw attention to is that of the dress of the Utopian priests mentioned near the end of the book, ‘wrought so finely and cunningly with divers feathers of fowls’ (TM, 117). This has been identified by Susan Bruce as pertaining to the ‘reports of tribes who wore feathers for decoration’ that appeared in ‘a number of early modern travel narratives’. After meeting them, Hythloday gives the natives teachings about Christianity, something they are quick and eager to adopt: ‘after they heard us speak the name of Christ […] you will not believe with how glad minds they agreed unto the same’ (107). This is something that echoes with that of the real-life position of Bartolomé de Las Casas in his role within his A Briefe Narration of the Destruction of the Indies by the Spaniards. \ The strict relationship I wish to draw between these two encounters is that of the attitude of the authors towards the natives, and in particular how this fits into the ‘larger debate’ held by contemporary thinkers of ‘the conquest of the Americas’ and ‘the Castilian crown’s sovereignty in America’. Though even Las Casas himself didn’t question this second point’s legitimacy, it’s clear from the text that, at least superficially, he views the natives he’s encountered as possessing enough merit to move ‘good’ (253) Christians with ‘pittie and compassion’, that doesn’t view them as others do as natural slaves. Discussing their susceptibility towards Christianity, Las Casas continually praises them for being ‘teachable and capable of all good learning’ (252), and ‘very apt to receive our holy Catholike Faith’. In the learning of this, he jokes that they are so enthusiastic that even ‘religious men have need of a singular patience to support them’, something that no doubt refers with a touch of seriousness to that Humanist concern regarding the perceived stagnation and ‘follies of Christian society’ as drove the Humanist project. \ Beyond their capacity for enthusiastic learning, Las Casas describes the natives in terms that specifically depict them as a race of perfect, if naïve, humans pre-Fall as it were, and indeed he explicitly goes on to discuss the New World as that of an ‘earthly Paradise’ (254), if only the Spanish had approached it as such. Calling them ‘Lambes so meeke’ (252), he describes their general way of living as being ‘without brawles and strugglings, without quarrels, without strife, without rancour or hatred’ (251); in other words, his idealised description depicts them according to the idea of Francisco de Vitoria that they were ‘natural children’ and ‘heirs to a state of true reason’, not slaves as some of his contemporaries do. \ Passages such as these, whilst claiming to extol the positive virtues of the native peoples, in fact quite explicitly erase their identity. Given that he was writing at a time when literally millions of people were being killed by the Spanish, Las Casas’ attempts to protect the native Indians from the ‘Wolves’ (252), ‘Lions’, and ‘Tigres’ of their oppressors can hardly be criticised from a moral standpoint, however in his attempt at imagining the Indies as a sort of new Eden, I argue, can be seen one of the implicit arguments that helped to further the cause of colonization. In much the same way as the English were to turn him into a ‘propagandist’ for their interests in the Americas, it is through claims such as ‘these folkes should bee the happiest in the World, if onely they knew God’ (252) that such writing is calls for the subjugation of the people it claims to protect. \ One of the conclusions drawn by Vitoria proves this point further. By his logic, as the natives are not naturally slaves but are in fact children, then like children they can be considered as being in ‘full possession of their rights [to their land] without being able to exercise them’, and therefore not only may the Spanish take that land and hold it ‘in tutelage’ until some undisclosed time in the future when the natives may be considered as having ‘reached the age of reason’, but this act may even be considered as one ‘of charity’. This is achieved by him through harking back to Roman philosophy, specifically that of Democrates, who said that ‘God gave property to man for his use’, which given that ‘no Indian society had had a monetary economy’ and that their precious metals were used for ‘idolatrous ends’, it was argued the Spanish were not ‘using’ their land in the correct way; the Spanish however, by turning it to more Christian designs, were able to ‘fulfil that obligation’ to God for them. \ Turning at this stage back to More and Utopia, this idea of correct ‘use’ of land can be seen in the attitudes of the islander Utopians themselves towards their mainland neighbours. Unlike in the previous example of Utopian behaviour, in this instance they seem to take on the role of the colonizer, rather than the colonized: when their population grows too high, the Utopians ‘build up a town under their own laws in the next land’ (63) and in doing so apparently bring about ‘great wealth of both the peoples [the Utopians and the natives]’. Much like the Spanish, the Utopian outlook on such expansion is a matter of the correct ‘use’ of the land and in this respect they echo many of the ‘real’ justifications given for similar actions as have been detailed already. The previous inhabitants are claimed to own ‘much waste and unoccupied ground’, which before the Utopian occupation was ‘neither good nor profitable for the one nor for the other’. And, just like the Spanish, the Utopian project is not merely a temporal conquest, but an ideological one as well. While they are happy to receive those ‘of the same country people to them’, to let the local population join their number, ‘if the inhabitants of that land will not dwell with them to be ordered by their laws, then they drive them out’. \ This passage gives a fairly verbatim account and justification of colonization in the form of Spanish expansion within the Americas at the time. Going further than this, it assumes the moral superiority of the Utopian society and uses this as the reason for their right, an idea reflected in the real world as something that is at the very core of the perception articulated by Juan de la Peña that native societies were riddled with ‘manifest errors […] before the arrival of the Spaniards’; errors that can only be corrected through the imposition of foreign codes of living. That the Utopian society itself is posited as the ‘Best State of a Commonwealth (10),  regardless of the contradictions in the text regarding whether or not it is an allegory for a ‘model Christian commonwealth’, serves only to entrench this idea as being a legitimate approach to the appropriation of other lands. If through reason alone this is how the Utopians have decided the best course may be laid for expansion, then one could in turn view the actions of the Spanish as being similarly justified. The euphemistic violence of their conquest even mimics this aspect of real world events, a fact that draws no comment from the characters of Hythloday or More in the text. \ More’s ideas, though not necessarily contributing to the real world scenario of colonization, were a part of a larger Christian Humanist dialogue which subjugated native peoples under the guise of propagating Christian virtues. The implicit arguments that underlie his writing serve to help further a more fundamental justification for this: in imagining the native peoples as being part of some Edenesque New World, the invasion of their lands could be seen as some sort of ‘return’ to a better land, rather than the taking of a new one. In this way, though he didn’t necessary engage explicitly with the ideas of natural slavery, his writing very much follows the thematics of this concept. \ ";
